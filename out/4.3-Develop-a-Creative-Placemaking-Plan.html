<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>In creative placemaking public, private, not-for-profit, and community sectors partner to strategically shape the physical and social character of a neighborhood, town, tribe, city, or region around arts and cultural activities. A community with a strong cultural identity leverages arts, culture, and entertainment to stabilize or strengthen a given place.</p>

<p>Creating a cultural identity, through art and cultural activities, enhances and stabilizes communities undergoing economic and demographic changes. By connecting individuals and organizations to and within the community, art and cultural activities encourage investment in public, semi-public, and private spaces. Supporting businesses develop or grow, drawing residents and other patrons to the place and the community. Creative places also provide positive branding and image for the host community.</p>

<p>According to the CT Department of Economic and Community Development's Office of the Arts, the arts are integral to building and unifying our communities, "63% believe the arts lift them up beyond everyday experiences; 73% believe the arts are a positive experience in a troubled world; 62% believe that the arts help them understand other cultures better; and 67% believe the arts unify their communities regardless of age, race, and ethnicity."</p>
