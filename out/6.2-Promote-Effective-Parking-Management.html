<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/6.2_Promote_Effective_Parking_Management.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Plan for and implement projects to make existing parking more efficient, reduce parking demand, and encourage walkability.</p>

<p>Complementary Actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/39">Implement Complete Streets</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/33">Integrate Sustainability into Plan of Conservation and Development</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/41">Encourage Smart Commuting</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Conduct a parking needs assessment. Determine whether to evaluate parking community-wide or in a specific area of your municipality, such as a downtown commercial district, and then prepare a map of the study area. Perform a complete parking inventory, counting the existing on-street and off-street parking spaces in the study area. The survey should also examine the number of cars and turnover rate (determined by recording license plates of all cars in the parking area) for the parking area being assessed. Examine existing parking needs, estimate future demand, and then evaluate and recommend parking strategies that will achieve the parking needs of the municipality. Present the parking needs assessment at one or more publicly advertised meetings. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The parking needs assessment (including a statement of purpose and summary of key findings), as well as evidence that the assessment was distributed to relevant municipal departments (either via email, in-person meeting, staff newsletter, etc.) and the date of the publicly advertised meeting at which the parking needs assessment was presented.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement non-regulatory and regulatory parking management strategies. <strong>(Up to 35 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Non-Regulatory Actions <strong>(15 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>Choose One per Certification Cycle</em><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Without more land or new construction, increase the capacity of parking facilities, such as through connected parking areas, cross-access easements, shared facilities, better striping to clearly define spaces, reducing parking space size, and using underutilized areas of existing parking facilities for small car spaces, motorcycles and bicycles; or</p></li>
<li><p>Create shared parking (i.e., two different entities with different demand times, like a school and a restaurant, share a parking lot).<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Regulatory Actions <strong>(20 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>Choose One per Certification Cycle</em><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rather than constructing more parking than is currently necessary, in anticipation of future demand, reduce the amount of impervious surface laid initially by allowing developers to bank land and maintain landscaped areas on the property that can be converted to parking if demand requires it in the future;</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a paid parking system with a pricing structure intentionally designed to reduce the time spent looking for parking and to promote efficient use of parking spaces and facilities; or</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate parking minimums, establish parking maximums, develop context-sensitive parking standards, unbundle parking from building development requirements, and/or establish fees-in-lieu of parking spaces.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A statement of the strategy or strategies implemented, a brief explanation of how each strategy advances the objective of this Action, and documentation showing the implementation of the selected parking management strategies. This may be a resolution or ordinance, meeting minutes or a letter from the municipal chief elected official or legislative body. If possible, submit before and after photographs that show a visible reduction in parking demands.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-5">Engaging Partners</h2>

<p>Sustainable CT encourages regional collaboration and other forms of partnership. For every action, please complete the “Partners” box in your submission, indicating the name(s) of any municipalities and/or organizations you partnered with (if any) and a brief description of your municipality’s role. If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Partners_Guidance_Document--FINAL.pdf">"Partners Guidance Document"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-6">Potential Municipal and Community Collaborators</h2>

<p>Municipal planning staff and the planning and zoning commission should lead implementation of this action, in partnership with the governing body who may ultimately implement policy changes. Additional community collaborators include municipal residents, private and public employers and their employees, and visitors to the community to help identify parking issues in the municipality that may be addressed by the parking program.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Strategic parking management can mitigate environmental impacts, including excessive land consumption, degraded water quality, and exacerbated heat island effects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging alternative modes of transit. Minimizing parking structures can also reduce energy used in construction, maintenance, and operation. Having the correct balance of parking is also vital to the economic development of your community.</p>
