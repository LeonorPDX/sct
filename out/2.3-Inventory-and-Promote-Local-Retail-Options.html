<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/2.3_Inventory_and_Promote_Local_Retail_Options.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last update 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Promote purchase of products and services from local businesses.</p>

<p>Complementary Actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/19">Provide Resources and Supports to Local Businesses</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/17">Implement Sustainable Purchasing</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Develop and distribute an inventory of local retail options. The inventory should serve as a comprehensive guide for residents of retail options (including non-brick-and-mortar businesses) that are located within the municipality’s boundaries and possibly including the nearby vicinity. Municipalities may choose to work collaboratively to develop a regional inventory. <a href="http://ctbusiness.ctdata.org/#/">Connecticut Business Registration Data</a> may be a helpful resource in ensuring the completeness of your inventory. The inventory should be posted on the municipality’s website. Further, either the inventory itself should be made available in hard copy, or for large inventories, hard copy flyers should direct residents to the electronic resource.</p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> The inventory should include the name and address of each retailer in both list form and plotted on a map. <strong>(5 points for the map, 5 points for the list, up to 10 points total)</strong></p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Incorporate special designations in the inventory for local businesses, sustainable, or eco-friendly businesses, women-owned, veteran-owned and minority-owned businesses, and alternative corporate structures, such as <a href="https://data.ct.gov/Business/Benefit-Corporation-Data/r8fi-whh5">B Corps</a> and cooperatively owned businesses. For retailers of locally grown food, the inventory could include designations for retailers that reliably sell fresh, local, in-season, native products. <strong>(5 points per designation, up to 10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Your inventory (in list <strong>and</strong> map form), a hyperlink and a screenshot of the relevant webpage(s) on which the inventory is posted, a brief description of how your inventory has been disseminated in hard copy in your community, and if applicable, a statement about which designation(s) your inventory incorporates. For regional inventories, each participating municipality will receive points.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop, implement and maintain an ongoing “buy local” campaign. Elements may include a campaign name, logo, slogans, tag lines, website, and social media platforms. In communication materials, the campaign needs to utilize a statement about <em>why</em> buying local is important to the community. A definition of “local” should be stated for purposes of the campaign. If any local retail inventories are created (please see item 1 above), the campaign should include their dissemination. Venues for and modalities of distribution of materials may include but are not limited to schools, child care centers, libraries, community centers, local health departments and districts, municipal tax bills and links on the municipality’s website. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Your completed “buy local” campaign discussion <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/2.3/2.3_Worksheet.docx">worksheet</a> and at least one example from among materials disseminated, which could include flyers, articles, letters, newsletters, presentations, or digital communications. For websites, submit both a hyperlink and a screenshot of the relevant webpage(s).</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type " Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-5">Engaging Partners</h2>

<p>Sustainable CT encourages regional collaboration and other forms of partnership. For every action, please complete the “Partners” box in your submission, indicating the name(s) of any municipalities and/or organizations you partnered with (if any) and a brief description of your municipality’s role. If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Partners_Guidance_Document--FINAL.pdf">"Partners Guidance Document"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Supporting independent and locally owned businesses produces a host of benefits. Such support can bring stability and diversity to the local economy, create jobs and expand municipal tax revenue, all promoting local and regional economic well-being. Local support can enhance social cohesion and build community. And buying local reduces transportation costs, and in turn, greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
