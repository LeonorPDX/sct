<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/2.5_Promote_Sustainable_Workforce_Development.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Increase local job opportunities in the sustainability sector to promote sustainable economic development in your municipality.</p>

<p>Complementary Actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/18">Inventory and Promote Local Retail Options</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/19">Provide Resources and Supports to Local Businesses</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<p>These actions may be implemented through partnerships with Workforce Development Boards, chambers of commerce, councils of government, other regional entities, or through collaboration among municipalities.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Conduct a sustainable jobs and workforce capacity assessment for your municipality or region. "Sustainable jobs" are job opportunities in the sustainability sector. Include an inventory of existing and projected sustainable job opportunities; assess workforce skill and capacity; and identify training areas that can close the gap between the skills of the workforce and the demands of current and anticipated sustainable jobs. Also, assess access, equity and diversity factors, including local demographics on workforce participation. Access to workforce development programs should be universal, without respect to economic circumstance, gender, race, ethnicity or national origin. Part of the process should include your municipality convening one or more roundtable discussions. Potential stakeholders should include marginalized and disadvantaged groups, such as small businesses, immigrants, low-income and minority job seekers and those from high unemployment neighborhoods. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The assessment, a completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/2.5/2.5.1_worksheet.docx">worksheet</a>, and a list of any roundtable events and the dates that they occurred. The assessment may be embedded in your region’s Community Economic Development Plan, if any. Submitting your workforce investment board’s federally required 4-year plan alone does not fulfill the requirements of this Action. However, it may serve as part of the submission, supplemented by municipal or regional collaborative efforts to provide additional information beyond what is in the plan and inclusive of the requirements above.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit”</a> Guidance Document for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish or support a sustainable job training partnership, for example, in sustainable construction and demolition, energy efficiency audits and retrofits, recycling systems, sustainable facilities management, sustainable landscaping, custodial operations, public works management or ecotourism. If possible, align your job training with the areas identified in the sustainable jobs and workforce capacity assessment (see above). Adopt measures that directly support racial employment equity and prioritize or set aspirational goals for the inclusion of marginalized and disadvantaged groups, including low-income individuals and those facing high barriers to employment, such as at-risk youth and the formerly incarcerated. Consult the Connecticut Department of Labor’s <a href="https://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/gendocs/training.html">list of employment and job training programs</a> for more information. Estimated impacts of any training program should be considered and evaluated. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A hyperlink and a screenshot of the relevant webpage(s) or hard copy materials describing the nature of the sustainable job training partnership.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To promote greater community commitment among potential employers, create networking opportunities for local job seekers to meet individuals working in or operating sustainable businesses. This action item can be completed by leveraging (if applicable) members of your local Sustainable Jobs Advisory Council, Workforce Development organization(s), Chambers of Commerce, or other appropriate entities. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A list of any networking events to foster employment opportunities in the sustainability sector specifically and the dates that they occurred.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-5">Engaging Partners</h2>

<p>Sustainable CT encourages regional collaboration and other forms of partnership. For every action, please complete the “Partners” box in your submission, indicating the name(s) of any municipalities and/or organizations you partnered with (if any) and a brief description of your municipality’s role. If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Partners_Guidance_Document--FINAL.pdf">"Partners Guidance Document"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-6">Potential Municipal and Community Collaborators</h2>

<p>Successful initiatives will involve partnerships with Economic Development Commissions, Planning and Zoning Commissions, and Workforce Development Boards, chambers of commerce and other business alliances, individual employers, labor unions, educational institutions and nonprofits and community-based organizations, such as community colleges.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Sustainable jobs provide Connecticut residents opportunity for financial advancement by allowing workers to support families while contributing to the health and vibrancy of their communities. Sustainable jobs are also inherently local, as they cannot be easily outsourced, with many opportunities coming from retrofitting infrastructure and installing sustainable technologies in homes and workplaces. Accordingly, the community benefits not only from carbon emission reductions but also increased economic vitality.</p>
