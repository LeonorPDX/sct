<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/5.7_Plan_for_Long-Term_Recovery.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last update 2021)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Establish a long-term recovery planning team to carry out responses after disasters (natural and/or manmade). Implement projects pre-disaster to be better prepared as a community.</p>

<p>Complementary Actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/34">Assess Climate Vulnerability</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/19">Provide Resources and Supports to Local Businesses</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify a Long-Term Recovery Manager and establish a long-term recovery committee. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>All elements must be completed to receive credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Identify a Long-Term Recovery Manager for your municipality. A regional Long-Term Recovery Manager may be appropriate for smaller towns with limited resources. The Long-Term Recovery Manager is the lead in pre- and post-disaster planning and recovery operations. The ideal Long-Term Recovery Manager would be an individual with planning and zoning experience in your community. If possible, the person selected should not have a competing disaster response role (for example, the Long-Term Recovery Manager should not also serve as the Emergency Management Director) and should be affiliated with your municipality (either as municipal staff or an active commissioner). As outlined in <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CTRecovers/Recovery_Framework.pdf">Disaster Recovery Framework and ESF 14 Version 1.0</a>, the Long-Term Recovery Manager may have the following responsibilities:</p>

<p><em>Pre-Disaster Responsibilities</em><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Serve as a primary point of contact for disaster recovery preparedness;</p></li>
<li><p>Establish and maintain contacts for disaster recovery resources and support systems; and</p></li>
<li><p>Promulgate principles and practices that further resiliency and sustainability in development and strategic planning initiatives. <br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Post-Disaster Responsibilities</em><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lead the creation and coordinate the activities of local recovery-dedicated organizations and initiatives;</p></li>
<li><p>Work with state officials to develop a unified and accessible communication strategy;</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in damage and impact assessments with other recovery partners;</p></li>
<li><p>Organize the recovery planning process for the community;</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure inclusiveness in the community recovery process;</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate recovery priorities to State and Federal partners;</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate critical mitigation, resilience, sustainability and accessibility-building measures into the recovery plans and efforts;</p></li>
<li><p>Lead the development of the community's recovery plans and ensure that they are publicly supported, actionable and feasible based on available funding and capacity;</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborate with State, Federal and other stakeholders to raise financial support for the community's recovery;</p></li>
<li><p>Work closely with the recovery leadership at all levels to ensure well-coordinated, timely and well executed recovery; and</p></li>
<li><p>Develop and implement recovery progress measures and communicated adjustments and improvements to applicable stakeholders and authorities. <br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The name and title of your municipally appointed Long-Term Recovery Manager, including the dates of tenure. Submit the job duties of your Long-Term Recovery Manager. If you have a regional Local Long-Term Recovery Manager, you must also submit documents outlining the regional partnership.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Committee/Task Force/Position Creation" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Appoint a Long-Term Recovery Committee that will be led by the Long-Term Recovery Manager. The Committee could include representatives from transportation, housing, education, economic development, health, and social services departments/organizations, as well as representatives from volunteer organizations, the faith-based community, and businesses. If you have identified a Regional Long-Term Recovery Manager, you may also identify a regional Long-Term Recovery Committee (the municipalities represented must be the same in both cases). Your Committee should have at least three members.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The names, titles, and affiliations of the Long-Term Recovery Committee members, including the dates of their tenure. Please submit a copy of the municipal meeting minutes documenting the establishment of your Long-Term Recovery Committee or other proof of the existence of the Committee. If you have a regional Long-Term Recovery Committee, you must also submit documents outlining the regional partnerships.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Committee/Task Force/Position Creation" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Establish a work plan that ideally includes a timeline for your Long-Term Recovery Committee. As outlined in the <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CTRecovers/Recovery_Framework.pdf">Disaster Recovery Framework and ESF 14 Version 1.0</a>, your Long-Term Recovery Committee should organize its work plan items by Working Group area, and could include: Natural and Cultural Resources Working Group; Community and Capacity Building Working Group; Economic Working Group; Individual Assistance Working Group; Health and Social Services Working Group; and an Infrastructure Working Group. Your Long-Term Recovery Committee should keep minutes of all meetings.</p>

<p>Consult the <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CTRecovers/Recovery_Framework.pdf">Disaster Recovery Framework and ESF 14 Version 1.0</a>, <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DEMHS/_docs/Plans-and-Publications/EHSP0025-SRFV41pdf.pdf">State of Connecticut: State Response Framework</a>, and <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DEMHS/_docs/Plans-and-Publications/EHSP0020-Local-EMD-CEOHandbook.pdf?la=en">CT Rises: Planning for Long-Term Disaster Recovery (pages 105-231)</a> for examples of action items for each working group area.</p>

<p>For example, the Natural &amp; Cultural Resources Working Group action areas might include coordination between departments and agencies to provide information and assistance to communities that want to preserve, protect and restore natural and cultural resources during recovery. The Community and Capacity Working Group action areas might include coordination of expertise for communities in planning and implementing pre- and post-disaster recovery programs, with an emphasis on hazard mitigation. The Economic Working Group action areas may focus on activities to help communities efficiently and effectively restore economic and business activities while adapting to market changes brought on by catastrophic events.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The work plan, and if available, timeline, for your Long-Term Recovery Committee.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete a project on the work plan of the long-term recovery committee. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Documentation of the activities performed by the Long-Term Recovery Committee, including a description of the task(s) completed, date of completion, and any relevant supporting documentation. You must first successfully complete 5.7.1 to be eligible for points under 5.7.2.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Connecticut is no stranger to disasters. Each event can be a learning tool to identify ways to be more resilient; to be quicker to respond; to be quicker to rebuild. This action calls upon your community to establish a planning team to prepare for and conduct long-term recovery efforts after a disaster. Different from the emergency response team, though closely coordinated, your Long-Term Recovery Committee will oversee the disaster response efforts after the immediate shock has been addressed and help your community build back stronger and safer.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>By establishing an active long-term recovery manager and committee your community will be better prepared to respond to future disasters and will likely reduce the impact of these events.</p>
