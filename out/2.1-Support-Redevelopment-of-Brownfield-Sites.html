<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/2.1_Support_Redevelopment_of_Brownfield_Sites.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Remediate and redevelop “Brownfields:” sites that are unused or underutilized because of contamination or the reasonable perception of contamination.</p>

<p>Free technical support to implement this action and get points towards certification is available. <a href="http://cbi.uconn.edu/for-communities/">Learn more and apply.</a></p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a municipal or regional brownfields inventory. Any private properties should be listed only with the owner’s consent. The inventory should include each site’s name, address, zip code, parcel number, status, site type, site size, current zoning, current owner, tax payment status, existing buildings and their square footage, and the availability of site photos and site documents as outlined in the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/2.1/2.1_Brownfield_Inventory_Template.xlsx">attached template</a>. Consider partnering with neighboring municipalities, or working through your council of governments to create the inventory. Ideally, the inventory should be updated as soon as any sited is identified, assessed or remediated. Inventories containing fewer than 5 sites may earn 5 points, those with 5-10 sites may earn 10 points, and those with more than 10 sites may earn 15 points. <strong>(5-15 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The completed brownfield inventory in the format provided in this <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/2.1/2.1_Brownfield_Inventory_Template.xlsx">template</a> or a comparable format, containing the same information.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a map of the brownfield sites within your community, either by marking up an existing municipal map manually, or by using an electronic Geographic Information System (GIS) base map. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A map of brownfield sites listed in the inventory. For maps available online, please provide a hyperlink and a screenshot of the relevant webpage(s).</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For communities with at least 10 brownfield sites, engage the community to prioritize brownfield sites for redevelopment. Priority sites may include critical brownfield sites that must be addressed because they pose a hazard, or brownfield sites that hinder the community meeting certain goals. You may consider factors like ownership, size, redevelopment potential, human health risk, ecological health risk, potential for open space, location within a redevelopment area, and potential for reducing blight. In addition to large downtown or waterfront projects with higher economic return, consider smaller sites that counter divestment, foster neighborhood cohesion, and build community wealth by creating jobs, educational youth development opportunities, and multiple entry points for residents to become long-term stewards of local, favorite places. Use a transparent public process to ensure that community members agree on the critical factors to consider in the site prioritization process. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The list of priority sites and the dates of the community planning meeting(s) or workshop(s) held.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Implementation Projects" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a grant proposal for site assessment or clean-up. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A copy of the verification of submission of the grant proposal, and where possible, a copy of the grant proposal.  Please also indicate in your submission whether the grant proposal is pending, or if a decision was rendered, whether or not the submission was funded.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Implementation Projects" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect additional information for one or more priority sites. Have a licensed environmental professional conduct a Phase I or Phase II environmental assessment, create a remedial action plan, market analysis report, land use analysis or study, end usage report and/or a remediation report.  <strong>(10 points per assessment, up to 20 points; either one assessment per site or two assessments on the same site)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong>  The assessments, plans and/or reports outlined above for which points are being sought for one or more priority sites, ideally incorporating photographs.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit.

</li>
<li>
<p>Hold a process of public engagement to identify potential reuse options that are connected to the broader community vision and revitalization priorities. You may engage the public by discussing various reuse options in a single public meeting, or by holding a series of design charrettes to develop reuse options or design criteria, or by other forms of public engagement. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A list of reuse options, which may be general to any brownfield site or specific to one or more brownfield sites, and the dates of any community planning events.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Implementation Projects" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate and actively market brownfield redevelopment opportunities. Information about potential redevelopment sites should include but not be limited to location, acreage, redevelopment context, ownership and who to contact for more information. List privately-owned sites only if you have permission from the property owner. Market redevelopment opportunities online at your municipality’s website, online databases of available commercial properties (like Connecticut Economic Resource Center Site Finder), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s brownfield map, and other websites that appropriately advertise opportunities for redevelopment. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Once you have addressed a site’s environmental contamination and remediated it, results include positive environmental impacts, including less redevelopment pressure on open land, potential increased health and wellness of local residents, and community-building. Specifically, remediated sites can provide housing, retail establishments, or public recreational and green space, among other potential uses for redevelopment, enhancing safety and promoting more active living and social interactions in a perhaps previously blighted area. Additionally, brownfield remediation and redevelopment can contribute to economic well-being and equity by improving the local economy and increasing the municipal tax base.</p>
