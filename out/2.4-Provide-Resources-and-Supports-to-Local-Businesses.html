<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Strong local businesses provide numerous economic, environmental, social and health benefits.</p>

<p>They may employ local residents, can create a unique sense of place that promotes community quality of life, and may have deeper roots than non-local businesses. Supported local businesses have the added opportunity to improve community-building.</p>
