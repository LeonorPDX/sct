<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action is available for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong> and was newly added in 2021.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Work collaboratively with other municipalities and through regional initiatives to broaden engagement and increase the impact of sustainability actions.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Mentor to, or seek a mentorship with, other towns on implementation of Sustainable CT actions. To receive points, your municipality must demonstrate some meaningful role in mentoring to, or seeking advice from, another town(s) on action implementation. A meaningful role of the mentor town might include: a presentation and interactive discussion about the action implementation to a committee or governing body of another town, or municipal staff time in assisting another town. A town can serve in up to three distinct mentor/mentee partnerships per application. <strong>(10 points for each town involved, up to 30 points per participating town)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/8.5/8.5_Worksheet_1.docx">worksheet 1</a>. Each mentor/mentee partnership must be documented separately (up to three entries per worksheet).</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement Sustainable CT actions regionally – Participate actively with other towns or regional organizations in the inventory, planning, or implementation of any Sustainable CT action. Active participation could include the following initiatives that support the implementation of Sustainable CT actions:<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mutual collection of data or inventory information;</p></li>
<li><p>Dedicating municipal staff time to drafting a joint/regional plan or policy;</p></li>
<li><p>Participation in COG regional programming that is not mandatory;</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration with neighboring towns on land development and land use regulations along town boundaries;</p></li>
<li><p>Participation on regional committees (such as watershed, greenway, housing, etc. committees); or</p></li>
<li><p>Implementation of multi-town projects (such as transportation, resilience or long-term recovery, etc.).<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each town actively participating in regional action implementation is eligible for collaboration points under this action in addition to any points the town may receive for the action implemented. <em>Note:</em> Collaboration must occur through a joint initiative between two or more municipalities. Soft collaboration, such as event cross-promotion or conducting outreach on behalf of another municipality, does not rise to the level of a joint plan, project, inventory, policy, or program as described in the examples above. <strong>(Each individual activity will yield 10 points per participating town, up to 30 points per town)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/8.5/8.5_Worksheet_2.docx">worksheet 2</a>. Each regional action must be documented separately (up to three entries per worksheet).</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-5">Engaging Partners</h2>

<p>Sustainable CT encourages regional collaboration and other forms of partnership. For every action, please complete the “Partners” box in your submission, indicating the name(s) of any municipalities and/or organizations you partnered with (if any) and a brief description of your municipality’s role. If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Partners_Guidance_Document--FINAL.pdf">"Partners Guidance Document"</a>.</p>

<p>Councils of governments, health districts, and other regional organizations; municipal staff from all departments as well as representatives from existing local commissions, committees, or community organizations; civic leaders, representatives from neighborhood organizations, seniors and youth; and community members who rely on or are impacted by public services and amenities, including transportation, built infrastructure, local municipal operations, planning, natural resources, land conservation, economic development and retention, housing, arts and culture, food systems, public health, community engagement, equity, etc. may be helpful in implementing this action.</p>

<p><em>Organizations and Relevant Programs</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/OPM/IGPP-MAIN/Responsible-Growth/Regional-Planning-Organizations-RPO">CT Regional Councils of Governments</a></li>
<li><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/Local-Health-Admin/Fact-Sheet-on-Health-Districts-in-CT-08-2016---Combined-2019.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=8DC4ACFA1B4592379F7E68A51F5BB87B">CT Regional Health Districts</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why this Matters</h2>

<p>Municipal collaboration fosters regional cohesion, knowledge sharing, and project and planning partnerships that can help advance sustainability across Connecticut efficiently. Many cross-cutting issues benefit from taking a regional approach, including transportation, community development, housing, open space acquisition, and many more.  Working across town lines can effectively help communities get to outcomes that are mutually beneficial to all participants, as well as the region at large.</p>
