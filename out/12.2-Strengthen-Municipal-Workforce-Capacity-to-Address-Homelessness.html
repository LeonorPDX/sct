<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Designate and train a municipal representative on homeless services in your municipality.</p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Designate a municipal employee, elected leader, or other individual officially designated by the municipality to serve as the point of contact for homeless services in your municipality.  Such person should either be a member of your municipality’s Sustainability Team or meet with the Sustainability Team at least annually.  Post the name, title and contact information of such person on your municipal website.  Register and keep up to date the name, title and contact information of such person with the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness as first contact for residents experiencing homelessness. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A hyperlink and a screenshot of the webpage that shows your designated point of contact for homeless services and a brief description of the relationship between your Sustainability Team and your designated point of contact for homeless services.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Committee/Task Force/Position Creation" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Have your designated municipal representative participate in one or more trainings related to addressing homelessness. Topics may include but are not limited to principles of the “Housing First” approach to homelessness, housing problem-solving (including shelter diversion), Trauma-Informed Care, and how the Coordinated Access Network system works in Connecticut.<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li>Attend 1 training = <strong>5 points</strong>
</li>
<li>Attend between 5 and 10 trainings = <strong>10 points</strong>
</li>
<li>Attend more than 10 trainings = <strong>15 points</strong><br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> Activities that are used to earn points toward this Action may not be used to earn points toward any other Sustainable CT event or training action (i.e., no “double-counting”).</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The name and contact information of the individual who attended the training and the name of the training, date(s) it occurred, and the organization that provided the training.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Events, Meetings, Trainings" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a municipal Task Force to address homelessness, or use your Sustainability Team or other existing municipal group.  The Task Force should ideally be composed of representatives from each municipal department that engages with individuals and families experiencing homelessness.  Its exact composition will depend on your community and may include at least one representative from the police force serving the community, library staff, schools, youth services, and senior services. The Task Force may also include representation from criminal justice and hospital systems. The Task Force should support your homeless services point of contact (see #2 above) in developing a comprehensive list of every individual or household experiencing homelessness and should meet at least quarterly to review the housing status of every person on the list (see also Sustainable CT Action <a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/70">Collect and Share Homelessness Data</a>).  Municipalities are encouraged to collaborate as appropriate. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A list of names and titles of current Task Force members and at least one additional piece of documentation related to the meetings, such as an agenda, minutes, presentation, sign-in sheet or photographs. At least one set of minutes should include a mission statement for the Task Force.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Committee/Task Force/Position Creation" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
