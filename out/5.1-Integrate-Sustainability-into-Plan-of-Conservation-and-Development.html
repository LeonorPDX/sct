<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2015/pub/chap_126.htm">Chapter 126 Section 8-23</a> of the Connecticut General Statutes requires each municipality to update a Plan of Conservation &amp; Development (POCD) at least once every ten years through its designated land use commission. Although this statute prescribes several elements to be included in the document to guide growth, development, and preservation, your community can address its unique context and initiatives by identifying overarching strategies and incorporating specialized analyses or studies.</p>

<p>Your POCD is your community’s guide and policy document and should be the basis for infrastructure and development related decisions, particularly in capital budgeting and project reviews. Integrate the principles of sustainability into the plan to ensure that they become part of your community's development.</p>

<p>Historically, planning and zoning separated commercial and residential uses. This practice promoted car-dependent sprawl. Increasingly, communities around the country are pursuing Smart Growth, transit-oriented development (TOD) and other sustainable, supportive planning and zoning strategies that promote more compact, walkable, mixed-use, environmentally sensitive communities with a range of transportation and housing choices. Demand for such communities comes from individuals at all points in their life.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>The POCD provides a framework for consistent decision-making. It establishes a long-range vision for the community and provides guidance and recommendations on future land use. As a vehicle for strategic planning, your land use commission may also identify implementation actions through which it achieves its intended goals. These implementation actions often stipulate either the creation of, or edits to, legally-enforceable zoning regulations, and mechanisms to guide development and protect resources. Including sustainability practices provides breadth and depth to multiple areas such as hazard mitigation, site design, transportation, economic development, infrastructure, and housing.</p>

<p>Results include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, enhanced sustainable economic development, reduced transportation costs, increased active transportation, and community cohesion, and more types of housing and more availability of affordable housing.</p>
