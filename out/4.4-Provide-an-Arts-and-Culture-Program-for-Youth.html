<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Celebrating arts and culture is essential to educating the ‘whole child.’ By finding the middle ground between cultural groups in a friendly and supportive setting, you support understanding that can alleviate community stress. Arts and heritage celebrations foster a sense of community and personal pride, and are often a meeting ground between generations. The conversations that arise in these events often support other partnerships between the school and the community.</p>

<p>According to the CT Department of Economic and Community Development's Office of the Arts, the arts are integral to building and unifying our communities, "63% believe the arts lift them up beyond everyday experiences; 73% believe the arts are a positive experience in a troubled world; 62% believe that the arts help them understand other cultures better; and 67% believe the arts unify their communities regardless of age, race, and ethnicity."</p>
