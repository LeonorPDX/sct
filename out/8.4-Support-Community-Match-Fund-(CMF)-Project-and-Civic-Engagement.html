<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/8.4_Support_Community_Match_Fund_CMF_Project_and_Civic_Engagement.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2021)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Collaborate with and support community partners in implementing <a href="https://sustainablect.org/funding/">Community Match Fund (CMF)</a> projects that closely align with, or meet the objectives of, any Sustainable CT action.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p>If a CMF project aligns directly with the steps of an action (i.e., the project fulfills the steps to completing an action, as detailed under the “What to Do” section of the action), then the project is eligible for points under the normal submission process for the relevant action. <em>You should not submit for points under 8.4 therefore.</em></p>

<p>If a CMF project does not align directly, but rather <em>aligns with the objectives of an action</em> (see “Objective” section of the related action), and you successfully complete the steps listed below, <em>then you should submit for points under 8.4.</em></p>

<p>Any municipalities that work collaboratively to complete this Action will each receive points as part of the collaborative. <strong>5 points for CMF projects involving one municipality; 10 points for CMF projects involving more than one municipality; 3 projects maximum eligible for points (up to 30 points)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Complete or support a substantially or fully implemented Community Match Fund project in your municipality that aligns directly with the objective of a Sustainable CT action.</p>

<p><em>All elements must be completed to receive credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> The project must meet all of the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/8.4/SCT_CMF_Eligibility_.pdf">CMF eligibility criteria</a>.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> The project idea must have been determined eligible by the Sustainable CT <a href="mailto:hildingsalorioa@easternct.edu">Community Outreach Manager</a>.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> The fundraising campaign must be posted to <a href="https://www.patronicity.com/sustainablect">https://www.patronicity.com/sustainablect</a> or <a href="https://ioby.org/sustainablect">https://ioby.org/sustainablect</a>.</p>

<p><strong>d.</strong> A municipal representative or member(s) of your Sustainability Team must have had a conversation with the project’s leader or the organization implementing the project. The Sustainable CT Community Outreach Manager will facilitate connections between municipal contacts and project leaders, and the topics below must have been discussed during that conversation(s):<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Clear identification of the Sustainable CT action objective that the project idea aligns with;</p></li>
<li><p>Alignment with your municipality’s Sustainable CT certification strategy;</p></li>
<li><p>Potential permitting requirements for the project idea;</p></li>
<li><p>Other potential project funding sources, which should be accessed prior to the Community Match Fund;</p></li>
<li><p>Other stakeholders in your community who might serve as potential partners; and</p></li>
<li><p>The potential to collaborate with other towns.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A completed action submission (<a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/8.4/8.4_Submission_Template.xlsx">template provided</a>) and at least 3 photos documenting CMF project progress and completion. You may include any additional information on collaboration and support for the project that you would like to provide.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Implementation Projects" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-5">Engaging Partners</h2>

<p>Sustainable CT encourages regional collaboration and other forms of partnership. For every action, please complete the “Partners” box in your submission, indicating the name(s) of any municipalities and/or organizations you partnered with (if any) and a brief description of your municipality’s role. If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Partners_Guidance_Document--FINAL.pdf">"Partners Guidance Document"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-6">Potential Municipal and Community Collaborators</h2>

<p>Municipal planners, economic development representatives, representatives from local environmental, conservation, inland wetland, historic preservation and land use and zoning commissions, and any municipal committees are potentially important stakeholders in facilitating Community Match Fund projects and implementing this action. Other relevant parties include local businesses, nonprofit organizations, and residents who may be interested in pursuing projects aligned with this action or supporting others’ projects.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-7">Why this Matters</h2>

<p>By facilitating collaboration between residents, municipal staff, and elected officials, municipalities become more inclusive and representative of the populations they serve. Empowering residents to identify and address needs in their communities enables them to play an active role in shaping their town.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-8">Benefits</h2>

<p>Projects which fall under this Action and utilize the Community Match Fund are eligible to receive up to 50% of their budget through this program, thereby enabling towns, organizations, and individuals to take on projects that might otherwise have been unaffordable. Apart from the matching funds, projects that align with this action will foster community engagement by encouraging residents to take a leading role in creating change in their communities and by facilitating collaboration with local government officials.</p>
