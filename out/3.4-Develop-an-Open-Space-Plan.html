<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Open space is defined in Connecticut State Statutes and further interpreted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2706&amp;q=511558&amp;deepNav_GID=1641">Green Plan</a>, as:</p>

<p>"Any area of undeveloped or relatively natural land, including forest land, land designated as wetland under section 22a-30, and not excluding farm land, the preservation or restriction of the use of which would (A) maintain and enhance the conservation of natural or scenic resources, (B) protect natural streams or water supply, (C) promote conservation of soils, wetlands, beaches or tidal marshes, (D) enhance the value to the public of abutting or neighboring parks, forests, wildlife preserves, nature reservations or sanctuaries or other open spaces, (E) enhance public recreation opportunities, or (F) preserve historic sites."</p>

<p>Connecticut’s open spaces, including agricultural land, bring tremendous value to the state, municipalities, residents, businesses, and tourists, not to mention the ecological value to support species diversity and success. All undeveloped land may become developed, unless protected. Balancing development with preservation is a challenge, but one that your community can overcome by establishing an open space/agricultural land preservation plan. Your plan should not only consider the outright protection (via fee-simple purchase and acquisition of conservation easements) but also the improvement of economic vitality of working lands. This plan may fit part and parcel with your municipality’s Plan of Conservation and Development.</p>

<p>Recognizing the threat of loss of environmental resources to changes in land use, the State of Connecticut set a goal of protecting 21% of the state’s land by 2023 for public open space. Of this 21%, 10% is to be acquired by the State of Connecticut, to be held and managed by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. The remaining 11% is to be acquired by municipalities, private non-profit land conservation organizations, water companies, and/or the federal government. It is important to note that the statewide goal does not directly translate to guidance that each municipality should seek to protect 21% of their municipal area. It’s up to you to identify your community’s protection goals.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>By thoughtfully balancing open space preservation with development, you can limit suburban sprawl and design your community to retain and highlight its natural features and environmental services.</p>

<p>By protecting your agricultural lands and working farms, you will increase your region’s food security.</p>

<p>By protecting open space, you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>preserve wildlife habitat;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>reduce pollutants and improve air and water quality, which will lead to improved health and quality of life for your neighbors, plants, animals, and beneficial insects (like native pollinators);<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>support and enhance the storm buffering capacity of your natural systems (e.g. wetlands);<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>sequester carbon; and<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>improve and enhance aesthetics, increasing the economic vitality of open space and allowing opportunities for recreation for current and future generations to enjoy.</p></li>
