A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/10.3_Improve_Air_Quality_in_Public_Spaces.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Educate on, plan for, and implement policies and projects to improve air quality by reducing smoking and tobacco use and excessive idling of motor vehicles.</p>

<p>Complementary Action:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/29">Manage Municipal Fleets</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Gather local and regional data in your community on tobacco use, tobacco cessation, health consequences and costs, and local vendors and points of access. Tobacco use includes but is not limited to cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (such as snuff and chew). Where possible, compare it to state and national metrics. One potential source of tobacco data is your local governmental public health department or district. Research effective educational and policy strategies to reduce smoking and tobacco use in your municipality. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A summary of the data outlined above and a list of educational and policy strategies your municipality will consider to reduce smoking and tobacco use. Please use the provided <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/10.3/10.3.1_worksheet.docx">worksheet</a> to submit your responses.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement or maintain a smoking and tobacco use reduction campaign. For example, conduct ongoing smoking and tobacco reduction education in schools, or place smoke-free and tobacco-free signage in public recreation areas. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Depending on the specific strategy or combination of strategies you chose, submit a list of names of any educational events and the dates that they were held, photographs of signage, or any other documentation that verifies your municipality’s ongoing efforts to reduce smoking and tobacco use. If photographs of signage are submitted, please include a caption with the name of each place the pictured signage is located.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt one or more policies designed to reduce tobacco use in your municipality. The strategies below are illustrative, but other innovative strategies not listed will also be considered. Strategies already required by Connecticut law, such as providing a smoke-free environment for municipal employees or children in schools, will not be considered for points. <strong>(15 points; credit for one policy per certification cycle)</strong><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prohibit smoking and tobacco use in outdoor public places, such as parks, recreational facilities, and at public events. Publicize the prohibition to the community. Post signs to educate the public, and appropriately enforce the prohibition.</p></li>
<li><p>Use licensing to place conditions on tobacco retailers, such as restricting the use of coupons and regulating the placement of products or advertising.</p></li>
<li><p>Use zoning ordinances to require tobacco retailers to be located in zones that do not contain facilities frequented by youth, or to lower the density and quantity of retailers by requiring tobacco retailers to be located a certain distance from one another, limiting the total number of retailers allowed in the area, or prohibiting the transfer or expansion of existing tobacco retailer building.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A resolution or ordinance formally adopted by your governing body, or a letter from the municipal chief elected official or legislative body to document implementation of one or more policies to reduce tobacco use in your municipality.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement or maintain a strategic campaign to prevent excessive idling of motor vehicles. For example, post “no idling” signs, distribute educational materials at municipal events and centers, or provide ongoing training to relevant municipal employees, such as school bus drivers, police officers, or public works vehicle drivers, among other potential strategies. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Depending on the specific strategy or combination of strategies you chose, submit photographs of signage, a list of names of any trainings for municipal staff and the dates that they were held, or any other documentation that verifies your municipality’s efforts to reduce excessive idling of motor vehicles.</p>
