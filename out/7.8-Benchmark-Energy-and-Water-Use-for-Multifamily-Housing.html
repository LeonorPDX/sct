<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/7.8_Benchmark_Energy_and_Water_Use_for_Multifamily_Housing.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Encourage multifamily property owners to analyze energy and water use data over time and implement projects to improve building energy performance, save money, and reduce carbon emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Multifamily housing</strong> is defined as residential properties with five or more units.</p>

<p>Complementary Action:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/21">Participate in and Promote the C-PACE Program</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Develop and implement an ongoing educational campaign, including hosting or sponsoring one or more educational forums, for owners of multifamily properties within the municipality. Demonstrate the importance and benefits of comparing their properties’ residential energy and water use over time. Demonstrate how and why to benchmark. Benchmarking involves comparing utility accounts, and energy and water use data from similar buildings over time, followed by analyzing trends in energy and water use patterns for each building. Platforms such as ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager and WegoWise aid in this process. Disseminate a current list of resources to help property owners implement energy and water-saving actions, including energy audits, retro-commissioning, and financing. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Overview of your outreach (5 sentences maximum); examples of materials used to engage in public outreach and education, which could include flyers, articles, letters, newsletters, presentations, digital communications, or any resource sheet(s) distributed; and a list of any educational forums and the dates they were held. For websites, submit both a hyperlink and a screenshot of the relevant webpage(s).</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track multifamily buildings that have had their energy and water use benchmarked, the dates covered, and the property owner(s) for the time period benchmarked. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> For each building benchmarked, submit a document containing the address of the property, the dates covered by the benchmarking, and if possible, the property owner(s) for the time benchmarked. If BenchmarkCT has been used, the <a href="http://www.ctgreenbank.com">Connecticut Green Bank</a> can provide evidence that the property has been benchmarked, though other platforms may be used instead.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Data Tracking/Benchmarking and Meeting Performance Metrics" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-5">Engaging Partners</h2>

<p>Sustainable CT encourages regional collaboration and other forms of partnership. For every action, please complete the “Partners” box in your submission, indicating the name(s) of any municipalities and/or organizations you partnered with (if any) and a brief description of your municipality’s role. If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Partners_Guidance_Document--FINAL.pdf">"Partners Guidance Document"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-6">Potential Municipal and Community Collaborators</h2>

<p>Any municipal departments involved with physical plant, facilities and operations, as well as departments engaged in community outreach, especially to property owners, should be involved in the implementation of this action. Additional partners include owners and managers of multifamily housing (apartment buildings and complexes, condominiums and cooperatives, congregate and senior housing, and mixed-use residential properties.) Owners may be municipal or federal housing authorities, non-profits or private owners. The Connecticut Green Bank, Connecticut Housing Finance Authority and utility companies can provide training on materials, benchmarking platform, and data acquisition.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-7">Funding</h2>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Benchmarking helps owners and property managers understand where their building portfolio’s energy and water use performance rank relative to other multifamily properties in the state. Benchmarking is an important tool and first step for informing resource saving opportunities and cost-effective investment decisions in energy and water improvement measures. It is a relatively easy, low-cost, low-risk action for gaining important building performance information. It is also an easy way to get owners thinking about and planning for building energy and sustainability, saving on operating costs, improving property values, improving the living environment for residents, and reducing tenant utility cost burdens.</p>
