<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>The primary component of solid waste in Connecticut is organic waste, most of which is discarded food. Through composting, food waste can become a precious agricultural resource (organic fertilizer). When food waste goes into landfills, it does not decompose, but rather off-gases methane. Not only does the off-gassing contribute to climate change, but also that earth-friendly fertilizer resource is lost.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>When you reduce the food waste in your community, you also lower the adverse environmental impacts on your air and water supply, reduce your greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease your solid municipal waste. As a result, both the sector targeted by your campaign and your municipality will save money through less over-purchasing and reduced disposal costs. Thoughtful and strategic donations of uneaten food can also ensure that low-income residents in your community have something to eat, helping build community and promote equity.</p>
