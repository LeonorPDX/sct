<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Educate residents via existing regional mobility managers, websites, and social media apps about alternative routes and transportation methods. Your community may also receive points for providing educational materials to residents directly about transportation options, including public transit, transportation network companies, transit districts, nonprofit transportation and other information relevant to use. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Overview of your outreach (5 sentences maximum) and examples of your outreach and educational materials, which could include flyers, articles, letters, newsletters, presentations, or digital communications. For websites, submit both a hyperlink and a screenshot of the relevant webpage(s).</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct a bicycle education program that teaches participants how to safely operate their bicycles in varied settings and improve bicycle riding and handling skills. To receive credit, the program must go beyond being an informational event and include an experiential, on-bicycle component. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The name of the program, the dates during which it was held, the number of participants, and a list of the learning objectives for the program.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through a process of community engagement, conduct a bicycle and/or pedestrian audit. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Your community engagement process should work to recruit participants who represent a diverse representation of town residents, including residents with various mobilities, races, ethnicities, and ages. Ideally, municipal leadership and/or staff would participate as well.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Prior to the audit, conduct a training event or orientation opportunity in which participants are given guidance on what an audit is, how it will work, and what to look for.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Using the AARP Walk Audit Tool Kit or a comparable guidance document, conduct your bicycle and/or pedestrian audit, inclusive of the availability and quality of sidewalks, curb ramps, crosswalks, crossing signals, and turning lanes; bicycle lanes, bicycle parking, and other bicycle infrastructure; traffic signals that support safe walkability, and any other additional components your municipality wishes to include. It is recommended that your audit follow a specific and intentional route that considers community connections, on which participants will take note of the above components. The audit should further include specific recommendations on opportunities to improve bikability and walkability.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Your bicycle and/or pedestrian audit report and your completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/6.5/6.5.3_worksheet.docx">worksheet 1</a>. At a minimum, your audit report must include a description of your audit route, your key observations and recommendations, and illustrative photographs. Recommendations should be specific.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Create and formally adopt a bicycle and/or pedestrian plan that includes a vision statement, goals and objectives; an existing conditions analysis; recommendations on policy changes; and an implementation strategy.  <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>With a robust process of community engagement and education, conduct a community mobility needs assessment. Identify study areas and evaluate: age and mobility demographics; economic information (projected job growth or loss and expected future income); community services (access to child care, access to health care, etc.); community access to all forms of transportation; and strategies to address first and last mile needs of transit and non-motorized transportation users. Also analyze: transportation gaps, based on existing transit options and demand estimates; zoning and transportation-related provisions, such as minimum net residential density within ½ mile of transit facilities (if any). Strategize to: address any problems revealed by the zoning analysis; diversify transportation options to meet the needs; and include recommended zoning changes. Consider coordinating this process with Sustainable CT Action <a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/22">Design and Implement an Affordable Housing Plan</a>. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Integrated, connected, and efficient transportation systems ensure that all residents have access to economic and social opportunities, and facilitate a healthy environment through greater physical activity and a thriving municipality. By promoting public transit and overall mobility, you empower your communities to evaluate a better method of transportation for themselves and their unique town needs. Moving away from single-occupancy vehicles and focusing on shared modes of transit frees up congested roadways, fosters cleaner air and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. This Action will also help to reduce your residents’ travel costs, giving them more money to spend in local businesses.</p>
