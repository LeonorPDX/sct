<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/9.3_Recycle_Additional_Materials_and_Compost_Organics.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Reduce residential solid waste and increase recycling of non-mandated materials and organics composting.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Create infrastructure to recycle additional materials that Connecticut law has not designated as <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Reduce-Reuse-Recycle/Recycling-Its-the-Law">mandatory recyclable items</a>. Such items include rigid non-HDPE and non-PETE plastic containers, textiles, and items covered under the Connecticut Product Stewardship program.* You may also include organics as non-mandated materials, through organics composting or organics biodigestion. In this case, you may send <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2718&amp;q=552676&amp;deepNav_GID=1645#SSOM">source-separated organics</a> to a <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/browse.asp?A=2718">permitted food waste composting facility</a> or you may operate an <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2718&amp;q=325344&amp;deepNav_GID=1645#Home">on-site composting program at a municipal facility.</a>** You may target education and implementation to specific populations, such as residents or schools, for example.  In all cases, be mindful of any potential barriers to participation. For each additional material recycled, you must provide educational materials to the population served. <strong>(10 points for each non-mandated material recycled, up to 40 points)</strong><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>*<a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2708&amp;q=447190">The Connecticut Product Stewardship</a> program makes producers responsible for end-of-life management (including recycling and/or disposal costs) of materials they originally produced, including mattresses, paint, plastic bags and plastic films. The program incentivizes municipal and retail collection of these materials for proper management, at no cost to your residents. Recycling of covered electronic devices (CEDS) – which include televisions, computers, monitors and printers – is mandatory in CT and thus is not eligible for points. However, recycling of electronics not covered by the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program (non-CEDs) could receive points, if the municipality can show that non-CEDs are actually being recycled, not just collected and disposed of.</p></li>
<li><p>**Recycling of leaves is mandatory in CT and grass clippings are banned from disposal, so programs for either of these items are not eligible for points. If your town actively promotes backyard composting by residents or composting at work, these activities are eligible for points under Sustainable CT Action <a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/51">Develop a Food Waste Prevention Campaign or Food Scraps Recovery Campaign or Program</a> (and not this Action).<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong></p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> Evidence of implementation of a program for each non-mandated material recycled, which could be in the form of a municipal ordinance, contract, or approved meeting minutes of your legislative body;</p>

<p><strong>b)</strong> If you collaborated with a nonprofit or business to collect or recycle the recycled material, submit a partnership letter or alternative documentation of the partnership that specifies that services to recycle the material have been provided within the past three years (please describe in the "partners" box of your submission). Alternative documentation could include a website hyperlink and a screenshot of the website or annual report of the partner organization which lists your town as participating in the recycling program; and</p>

<p><strong>c)</strong> Examples of outreach materials, such as flyers, articles, events, or links to town website pages that clearly describe how your constituents can participate in the program to recycle the material.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-5">Engaging Partners</h2>

<p>Sustainable CT encourages regional collaboration and other forms of partnership. For every action, please complete the “Partners” box in your submission, indicating the name(s) of any municipalities and/or organizations you partnered with (if any) and a brief description of your municipality’s role. If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Partners_Guidance_Document--FINAL.pdf">"Partners Guidance Document"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-6">Potential Municipal and Community Collaborators</h2>

<p>As the first point of contact, the municipal recycling coordinator or other appropriate municipal staff involved in materials management should be involved in the implementation of this action. In addition to the recycling coordinator, a team of municipal staff and volunteers typically supports the municipality’s recycling coordinator’s waste reduction and recycling efforts. The coordinator should work to standardize the program(s) and, if possible, grow the program(s) with additional tonnages. A list of recycling coordinators for each Connecticut municipality <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2714&amp;q=324868">can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>The development of new or more comprehensive municipal recycling programs is essential to Connecticut achieving its goals of recycling 50% of the municipal solid waste stream and 60% of the total solid waste stream by 2024.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Successful non-mandated recycling programs decrease pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that stem from methane production and waste incineration emissions. Cleaner air leads to better health and wellness of community members. Waste reduction can also net your community significant financial savings and promote economic well-being.</p>
