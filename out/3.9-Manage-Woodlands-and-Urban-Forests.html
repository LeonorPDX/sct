<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/3.9_Manage_Woodlands_and_Urban_Forests.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Plan and implement projects to increase tree cover and enhance tree, forest, and woodland health.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Establish a Forestry Advisory Committee (FAC). The Committee will report to municipal leadership, but does not require formal appointing. Members could include the municipal tree warden, local volunteers, nonprofit organizations, councils of governments, and local organizations. The FAC might also engage a state Certified Forester. An existing forestry commission or similar entity may serve as the FAC, but should consider broadening representation to include the stated list. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A list of members of the Forestry Advisory Committee and the date of the most recent meeting.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Committee/Task Force/Position Creation" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Forestry Advisory Committee must complete one or more activities from the following list, or one of great importance to the municipality (if not listed). <strong>(10 points)</strong><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Assess the tree cover within the municipality. See <a href="https://clear.uconn.edu/%5C/projects/landscape/v2/forestfrag/statewide.htm">Appendix A</a> for recommendations regarding the assessment of tree cover.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish general categories to describe trees in sites where your governing body and tree warden have direct responsibility, such as ‘street trees’, ‘parks’, ‘open space’ and other classifications of ‘forests/woodlands on municipally owned land’. Placing tree cover into various categories makes it easier to determine specific areas of focus. Your FAC can also assess the extent of tree cover on private properties and on non-municipally owned public property (e.g., state highway land, state park land). Prepare a map to illustrate this tree cover. See <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/media/Content/For_resources/LNR/Appendix_B.pdf">Appendix B</a> for a list of guiding questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Assemble and review existing municipal policies regarding trees and forests within the municipality. Determine whether your community needs to develop additional policies and implementation plans related to planting plans, tree diversity, property development, tree maintenance, the use of forested and wooded areas for recreation and other purposes, and other priority areas relating to the management of public trees. Develop those policies as needed, as recommendations to your municipality. See <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin//media/Content/For_resources/LNR/Appendix_C.pdf">Appendix C</a> for a list of guiding questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the FAC’s assessment of the municipal tree cover and the policies developed, establish a set of specific goals for your community to achieve regarding its trees and forests. Assemble these goals into a Municipal Forest and Woodlands Management Plan. This plan should reference needed resources and funding. See <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin//media/Content/For_resources/LNR/Appendix_D.pdf">Appendix D</a> for a list of guiding questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a tree planting program based on the specific goals the FAC either stated or outlined in its Municipal Forest and Woodlands Management Plan. Include an approved species list of native plantings, a location map of planned plantings, and a maintenance plan for these trees. See <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin//media/Content/For_resources/LNR/Appendix_E.pdf">Appendix E</a> for a list of guiding questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide updates on findings and recommendations from the FAC to your local administration or governing body. Respond to requests of the local administration or governing body regarding forestry/woodlands needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Sponsor or host a forestry and woodlands education campaign (can be run by a third party partner). Provide educational materials to private forest owner (for example, share information on PA 490 “An Act Concerning the Taxation and Preservation of Farm, Forest, or Open Space Land."<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Documentation of the activities performed by the Forestry Advisory Committee, including all elements outlined in at least one item listed above.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Committee/Task Force/Position Creation" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-5">Engaging Partners</h2>

<p>Sustainable CT encourages regional collaboration and other forms of partnership. For every action, please complete the “Partners” box in your submission, indicating the name(s) of any municipalities and/or organizations you partnered with (if any) and a brief description of your municipality’s role. If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Partners_Guidance_Document--FINAL.pdf">"Partners Guidance Document"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-6">Potential Municipal and Community Collaborators</h2>

<p>Staff from the planning and zoning and public works departments could be helpful in implementing this action.</p>

<p>In addition, the tree warden, planning and zoning commission, conservation commission, local organizations, council of governments, and local land trust(s) could help implement this action.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Forests and street trees bring many values to a community, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Improving air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and other pollutants,<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Shading (which reduces urban heat island effect),<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Providing habitat for animals and birds,<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Beautification,<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Creating a sense of place, and<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Enhancing safety (for example, the presence of street trees reduces urban traffic speeds).</p></li>
