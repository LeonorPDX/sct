<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/10.2_Conduct_Health_Impact_Assessments.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Integrate public health and equity considerations when developing and implementing projects, initiatives, and policies in sectors where the connection to health may not be immediately obvious.</p>

<p>A <strong>Health Impact Assessment</strong> (HIA) is a process that uses data, analysis and stakeholder input to determine the potential health impacts of a proposed policy, plan, program or project. A HIA also provides recommendations on monitoring and managing those effects. Please note that health impact assessments are different than community health needs assessments (CHNA). HIAs are designed to bring health evidence to inform a specific decision. CHNAs are designed to develop strategies to address a community’s identified health issues.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Have your elected officials and/or staff members participate in a training on performing health impact assessments. Then, have them give a presentation at a public meeting to your municipality’s elected officials about health impact assessments and how your community can conduct one. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The names and contact information of the individuals who attended the training, as well as the name of the training, the date it occurred and the organization that provided the training.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Events, Meetings, Trainings" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct a health impact assessment (HIA) on a proposed project, initiative or policy in your community, facilitating opportunities for meaningful community engagement and public input at each step in the process. HIAs consider a broad view of health, including the social determinants. To complete the HIA, perform the following steps, which were adapted from the Health Impact Project’s description of the <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/health-impact-project/health-impact-assessment/hia-process">HIA Process</a>. <strong>(20 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>All elements must be completed to receive credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> <em>Screening</em>. Through a partnership of your Sustainability Team and your municipality’s public health department or regional health district, identify specific proposed projects, programs or policy decisions that an HIA could address. Consider feasibility in terms of available resources (like funding, time, data, and stakeholder interest), the importance of potential health outcomes, and the likelihood that the HIA may provide new and important information on previously unrecognized health issues. An HIA should always be conducted prospectively.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> <em>Scoping</em>. With stakeholders, create specific objectives for the HIA, including a determination of the health effects to be addressed and populations to be impacted.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> <em>Assessing.</em> Describe the baseline health of affected communities and the potential impacts of the decision. In the baseline health analysis, discuss the social determinants of health, like community walkability and food access. Explain how health risks and benefits fall among different subgroups, stratified by race and ethnicity, income, age and chronic illness status, among other possible groupings. You may obtain this information from your municipal health department’s or district’s community health needs assessment, if any.</p>

<p><strong>d.</strong> <em>Recommending</em>. Develop practical solutions for implementation within the political, economic or technical limitations of the project or policy you’re assessing. These may include minimizing or mitigating potentially adverse health consequences or maximizing positive health impacts.</p>

<p><strong>e.</strong> <em>Reporting</em>. To facilitate the adoption of your HIA's recommendations, strategically disseminate the findings to decision-makers, affected communities, and other stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>f.</strong> <em>Monitoring and Evaluating</em>. Monitor the changes in health or health risk factors and evaluate the efficacy of the HIA process and the measures your community implements.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A copy of the health impact assessment, a <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/10.2/10.2.2_worksheet.docx">completed worksheet</a>, evidence that the health impact assessment was strategically disseminated (either via email, in-person meeting(s), other channels, or some combination thereof), and a hyperlink to the health impact assessment on your municipality’s website. <em>Please note</em> that a community health needs assessment is not the same as a health impact assessment and is not eligible to receive credit under this Action.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>
