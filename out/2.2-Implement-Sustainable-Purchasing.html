A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/2.2_Implement_Sustainable_Purchasing.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Commit to purchasing sustainable goods and services.</p>

<p>Complementary Action:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/19">Provide Resources and Supports to Local Businesses</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>Note:</em> When determining if goods and services are sustainable, the following sample environmental attributes can be considered: Biobased, biodegradable, bisphenol-free, carcinogen-free, Chloroflurocarbon (CFC)-free, compostable, durable, energy efficient, flame retardant-free (especially halogenated flame retardants), free of antimicrobial chemicals, heavy metal free (e.g. no lead, mercury, cadmium), less hazardous, low Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) content, low-toxicity, made from renewable materials, Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl-free, phthalate-free, reduced packaging, refurbished, reusable, water efficient.</p>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Have municipal elected officials and/or staff members and/or commission members participate in a sustainable procurement training. Any training pursued here may not also count for points under Sustainable CT Action <a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/46">Train Municipal Representatives</a>. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The names and contact information of the individuals who attended the training and the name of the training, the date it occurred, and the organization that provided the training.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Events, Meetings, Trainings" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By municipal resolution or ordinance, adopt a sustainable purchasing policy, distribute the newly adopted policy to  relevant department or division heads, publish the policy to the municipal website, and communicate the policy to relevant suppliers and vendors. At a minimum, the policy should address two social impact areas and four additional environmental impact areas: <strong>(20 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>Social Impact Areas</em><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Promotion of purchasing cooperatives;</p></li>
<li><p>Engagement with locally-owned businesses, sustainable, or eco-friendly businesses, minority and women-owned businesses, and alternative corporate structures, such as <a href="https://data.ct.gov/Business/Benefit-Corporation-Data/r8fi-whh5">B Corps</a> and cooperatively owned businesses (a definition of “local” should be stated for purposes of the policy); and</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase of goods and services that are certified “fair trade” or are otherwise ethically sourced and free from forced labor and/or child labor.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Environmental Impact Areas</em><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Recycled-content, reused and/or refurbished products;</p></li>
<li><p>Less harmful and/or non-toxic materials and processes;</p></li>
<li><p>Energy and water-efficient products and processes;</p></li>
<li><p>Natural resource and landscaping including implementing a green grounds and management maintenance program;</p></li>
<li><p>Renewable energy products, such as solar, wind and/or hydropower;</p></li>

<li><p>Other topics consistent with the objective of this Action that your municipality deems appropriate. <br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sustainable purchasing policies may include any other topics your municipality deems appropriate. Your municipality may establish a formal policy or submit documentation to prove that your municipality utilizes WaterSense labeled products under. You may still include management of municipal water use in your sustainable purchasing policy, but you may not count managing municipal water use as one of the four or more environmental impact areas you highlight in your sustainable purchasing policy under this Action. Similarly, there is no double-counting with other Sustainable CT Actions that overlap with sustainable purchasing policy areas.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The sustainable purchasing policy that the governing body adopted by resolution or ordinance, as well as evidence that you distributed the adopted policy to relevant municipal departments (either via email, an in-person meeting, a staff newsletter or other channels) and a completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/2.2/2.2.2_worksheet.docx">worksheet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement your municipality’s sustainable purchasing policy. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> An estimate of the percentage of your municipal budget used to purchase sustainable goods and services and a brief narrative description of which goods and services are sustainably purchased by your municipality and which social and environmental impact areas in your sustainable purchasing policy are impacted.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and maintain an up-to-date vendor list to use for requests for quotations, small purchases where no quotes are required, requests for proposals, and other purchasing opportunities. Your list must incorporate special designations, which may include those for locally-owned businesses, sustainable, or eco-friendly businesses, minority and women-owned businesses, and alternative corporate structures, such as <a href="https://data.ct.gov/Business/Benefit-Corporation-Data/r8fi-whh5">B Corps</a> and cooperatively owned businesses. You may choose to collaborate with representatives from other communities to develop a regional vendor list. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The vendor list, including an explanation of the special designations incorporated into the list. For regional vendor lists, each participating municipality will receive points.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points.
