<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/8.1_Hold_a_Sustainability_Event.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Bring together your community in fun, informative, and constructive ways through energetic events that can model and engage residents and business owners in sustainability practices.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em> <strong>(up to 15 points)</strong></p>

<p>A sustainability event is a free, public event on a specific sustainability topic, or a free, public event on any topic that incorporates a sustainability practice (e.g., zero waste event) and educates participants about that sustainability practice.  For the purposes of this action, a sustainability topic is one that aligns with any of the Sustainable CT action categories (e.g., thriving local economies, clean and diverse transportation systems and choices). For a series of sustainability events held on multiple dates, each date counts as one event (e.g., each date a farmers’ market is held is an event, each date in a multi-day film series counts as an event). Points will be awarded as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hold 1 sustainability event = <strong>5 points</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Hold between 5 and 10 sustainability events = <strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Hold more than 10 sustainability events = <strong>15 points</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Activities that are used to earn points toward this Action may not be used to earn points toward any other Sustainable CT Action (i.e., no "double-counting").</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Support and hold a sustainability event, track data and evaluate. <strong>(variable points, see above)</strong></p>

<p><em>You must complete all of the following submission steps for each event. Please complete the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/8.1/8.1_template.xlsx">Hold a Sustainability Event template</a> as part of your action submission.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Hold a sustainability event. Possibilities for events include, but are not limited to:<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Panel Discussions</em> on different aspects of sustainability;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Film Festival</em> of earth-friendly documentaries;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Local Food</em> farmers’ market or dinner;</p></li>
<li><p><em>A Green Fair</em> that educates and encourages people of all ages to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle;</p></li>
<li><p><em>House Tour</em> of homes that have introduced green technologies or passive technologies;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Car Show</em> of fuel-efficient vehicles that includes education about driving and maintenance practices that reduce emissions and consumption and shows how to avoid idling;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Art Attack</em> showcases environmentally-themed, or sustainably made artwork in and around areas of your community not typically designated as art spaces;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Themed/Holiday Event</em> such as an energy vampire walk through a school to discover energy losses (it’s a haunted house that’s scary because it isn’t sustainable);</p></li>
<li><p><em>Active and Passive Recreation</em> events such as trail system creation or beautification;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mobility Awareness Day</em> provides information about transit and vehicle options, offers transit tickets at town offices and local stores, and shares a list of places in town open to recreational walking and biking;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Safe Routes to Schools Program</em> shows families safe bicycle and walking routes for their children to get to school;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Large-scale Open Streets Event</em> temporarily closes the street to cars in multiple neighborhoods, thus encouraging outdoor play, walking, biking, and neighborhood block parties; and</p></li>
<li><p><em>Zero Waste Event</em> for any public event that promotes waste reduction and manages materials so that all are recycled or composted.<br><br></p></li>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>In and of themselves, events are excellent communications tools. If your community wants to become a leader in sustainable living and working, then adding a sustainability component to an existing event or developing a new one that focuses on environmental stewardship will communicate that intention both within and outside the community.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Events bolster town pride by giving all community members the chance to come together, share experiences, build collective memories, and plan for the future. An engaging event can have educational value, entertainment value, and opportunity for new business or economic development that will contribute to overall community health.</p>

<p>A well-planned event, customized to meet the needs, interests, and unique character of your community, will weave sustainable considerations into your culture.</p>
