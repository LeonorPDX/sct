<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/3.7_Provide_Education_on_Water_Conservation.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Educate and empower all businesses and residents to reduce their water use.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>Note:</em> Water conservation and watershed protection are different educational topics. Points may be eligible for the latter under the Provide Watershed Education action.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Provide Education on Water Conservation <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>All elements must be completed to receive credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Sponsor or host a water conservation education workshop that targets local businesses and/or residents in your community (whether they tap municipal water or use a private well) and goes above and beyond current campaigns required to attain the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit. Your local water company, council of governments or health district may be able to assist. Workshops may be coordinated with neighboring municipalities.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A description of your water conservation education workshop and the date it was held.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Events, Meetings, Trainings" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Identify and disseminate water conservation educational materials to businesses and/or residents. Consider reaching audiences through multiple communications channels, such as online, at events, printed materials (at libraries, grocery stores, restaurants, in tax bills, town booklets), etc.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> An overview of your outreach strategy (5 sentences maximum), including target populations (if any) and at least one example from among the materials disseminated, which could include flyers, articles, letters, newsletters, presentations, or digital communications. For websites, submit both a hyperlink and a screenshot of the relevant webpage(s).</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Less than 1% of the Earth’s freshwater is readily accessible for human use. Many people use more water than they need without knowing it. The average American family uses more than 300 gallons of water per day. Excess water often strains sewage systems and contaminates groundwater as dirty water seeps from the sewage system and into the ground. Contaminated groundwater pollutes swimming water and soil, resulting in low quality food crops grown in area gardens or farms.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Inform residents about how they might be using more water than needed for any given task, and how they can cut the waste without sacrificing comfort or performance.</p>

<p>Empower and motivate people to conserve water with information about relatively simple and cheap methods. By employing these easy practices, like shortening showers or dumping leftover ice on plants instead of down the drain, residents can save money and make a difference.</p>

<p>Water conservation keeps water in aquifers, reservoirs, streams, rivers, etc., where it can support aquatic habitats and be available for produce growing. This also better prepares the state and communities for future droughts, by having more of this invaluable resource in reserve, and by making water conservation the norm, rather than an emergency measure.</p>
