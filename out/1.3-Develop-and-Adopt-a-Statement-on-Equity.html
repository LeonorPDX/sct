<ol>
<li>
<p>Develop, adopt (through municipal governing body and/or board of selectmen), and publicly share a statement on your community’s shared vision for equity. Your statement should be unique to your town, written through a lens that addresses both the town’s specific history with inequity/injustice and the current challenges being faced. You should consider current municipal processes that promote inclusion and cohesion and that ensure adequate representation of all community members. <strong>(15 points)</strong></p>

<p>You must use the following concepts within your town’s equity statement:<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Recognition of a need for systemwide change, historic and current weaknesses in systems in place, and the need for a more equitable path going forward;</p></li>
<li><p>Your town’s commitment to protecting current and future residents, with special consideration for marginalized communities; and</p></li>
<li><p>A vision for future municipal processes that will address past and current inequities.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Your town’s equity statement, the date it was adopted by the municipal governing body and associated documentation of the adoption (such as meeting minutes or agenda), and a description of outreach conducted to make the statement publicly accessible.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Building inclusive and equitable communities is a process that recognizes the intrinsic value of each member of a community and the need to connect; and is achieved when social, economic, and political opportunities are not predicted based upon a person's race, gender, age, or sexual identity. To build communities that embrace equity, Sustainable CT cities and towns will create a table where diverse relationships are welcomed and valued, where decisions are made collectively, and where success will be measured by having a variety of perspectives and experiences represented. Sustainable CT encourages cities and towns to include marginalized voices in their decision-making processes, and to specifically identify barriers to access for marginalized residents in order to identify and respond to community priorities.</p>
