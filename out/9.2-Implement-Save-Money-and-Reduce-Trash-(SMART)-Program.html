<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/9.2_Implement_Save_Money_and_Reduce_Trash__SMART__Program.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Reduce residential trash generation.</p>

<p>Complementary Actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/48">Report Materials Management Data and Reduce Waste</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/50">Recycle Additional Materials and Compost Organics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/51">Develop A Food Waste Prevention Campaign or Food Scraps Recovery Campaign or Program</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Build a SMART Task Force or use your Sustainability Team to facilitate the completion of the steps needed for ultimate SMART program implementation. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>All elements must be completed and outlined in the worksheet provided to receive credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong>  Designate a person(s), agency(ies), or committee to lead the SMART Task Force. Potential membership is outlined in the Potential Municipal and Community Collaborators section below, may begin with your existing Sustainability Team, and should include diverse stakeholders representing at least three different sectors (e.g., local elected officials, municipal staff, community stakeholders, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong>  Reach out to and meet with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for partnership, guidance and support, which may include funding assistance.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong>  <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/9.2/9.2.1_Worksheet.docx">Complete the remainder of this worksheet</a> to guide the SMART Task Force’s initial efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A list of members (including titles/professional affiliations) of the SMART Task Force; the date of the most recent SMART Task Force meeting; the contact information of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection liaison who is supporting your efforts to implement a SMART program; and a completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/9.2/9.2.1_Worksheet.docx">SMART Task Force worksheet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Committee/Task Force/Position Creation" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct research, an analysis, and internal education regarding SMART program adoption. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>All elements must be completed to receive credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Analyze municipal collection methods, hauler requirements, contract expiration dates, and the distance municipal waste is being hauled and cost structure for collection.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Calculate the projected cost savings or new municipal revenue you would gain as a result of implementing a SMART program.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Research how other municipalities have implemented SMART, including a visit to at least one municipality with a SMART program.  Using residential solid waste generation per capita as a benchmark, compare SMART to other waste reduction strategies, such as education programs, reward programs, and overflow programs.</p>

<p><strong>d.</strong> Educate elected officials in small groups to explore internal support for SMART.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/9.2/9.2.2_worksheet.docx">SMART program worksheet</a>, inclusive of the required elements above.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Outreach, Education, Programs, Campaigns, Recognition/Designation in External Program, and Funding" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By municipal resolution, ordinance, or another implementation mechanism, adopt a SMART program consistent with the following framework:  <strong>(20 points)</strong> <br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Has a linear or near-linear rate structure for disposal (collection can be a flat fee);</p></li>
<li><p>Uses a bag, a tag, or variable-sized carts; and</p></li>
<li><p>Has cart pricing that increases significantly with size, to incentivize waste reduction.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Additional Notes:</em><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>For a program at a community transfer station, collection must occur by the bag (not weight) with an initial bag size of no larger than 15-30 gallons.</p></li>
<li><p>Any curbside variable sized cart program must offer a small unit size option of no larger than 15-30 gallons, in addition to at least two larger sizes offered, and ideally should utilize monthly or quarterly billing to incentivize waste reduction.</p></li>
<li><p>Any curbside bag (including bag in a cart) program must offer a small unit size option of no larger than 15-30 gallons, in addition to larger sizes offered.</p></li>
<li><p>An overflow program that charges residents for “extra” trash is not considered a SMART rate structure.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>You may mandate a SMART rate structure for residential subscription haulers through their permitting process. SMART is an effective pathway to achieving reductions in residential solid waste generation per capita, eligible for points under Sustainable CT Action <a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/48">Report Materials Management Data and Reduce Waste</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Documentation showing the implementation of SMART. Documentation may be a resolution or ordinance formally adopted by your governing body, meeting minutes or a letter from your chief elected official or legislative body.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit.

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Waste-to-energy facilities contribute to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases. Reducing, reusing, re-purposing, recycling, and composting keep items out of these facilities. Comparison studies show that “SMART” towns recycle more and dispose of less waste than neighboring communities.</p>

<p>A key to making SMART work is providing opportunities for people to do something with their trash other than throwing it out. Waste reduction programs, reuse facilities, expansion of curbside collection services, and yard and other organic waste composting programs are complementary activities that enhance the impact of SMART (See the <a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/50">Recycle Additional Materials and Compost Organics</a> and the <a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/51">Develop A Food Waste Prevention Campaign or Food Scraps Recovery Campaign or Program</a> Actions.)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>When you implement SMART, your town will be measurably reducing waste generation. This Action produces environmental benefits, greenhouse gas reductions, improved community health and wellness, municipal and residential cost savings, and potentially enhanced economic well-being.</p>
