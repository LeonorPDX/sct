<p><em>Note:</em> The United Stated Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines literal homelessness as follows: “Individuals and families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and includes a subset for an individual who is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less and who resided in an emergency shelter or a place not meant for human habitation immediately before entering that institution.” “Unsheltered” refers to individuals and families who meet this definition and are not currently residing in a shelter. For more background on how HUD defines different categories of homelessness, click <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/PIH2013-15HOMELESSQAS.PDF">here</a>.</p>
