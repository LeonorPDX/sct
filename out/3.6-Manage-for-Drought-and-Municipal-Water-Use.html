<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Water is a precious natural resource. Connecticut typically receives ample precipitation, however, occasional droughts can have widespread impacts on water availability, which is especially detrimental for produce growers and thus availability of locally-grown food. Overuse of surface and groundwater systems can also stress aquatic environments.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Water conservation preserves and protects water resources, keeping more water in reservoirs, streams, and rivers, thus supporting human health and aquatic habitats. Conservation also keeps aquifers charged, so more water is available during times of drought than otherwise would be available.</p>

<p>By making water conservation the norm, rather than an emergency response, you empower your community to survive, and even thrive in a time of drought.</p>
