<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Other than personnel costs, energy (electricity and heating fuel) is usually every municipality's highest expense. Traditional fossil fuels, like natural gas, propane, diesel, and heating oil, are not renewable, have fluctuating costs, and generate significant adverse environmental impacts through their extraction and combustion.</p>

<p>The use of fossil fuels to generate electricity leads to harmful emissions of both greenhouse gases and air pollutants. Greenhouse gases have a long-term detrimental effect on public health and the environment. Additionally, criteria pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, ozone and particulate matter immediately affect public health. These emissions include known carcinogens and contribute to an increased incidence of pulmonary diseases in both children and the elderly. Connecticut is nonattainment for both particulate matter and ozone.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Renewable energy generation reduces your community’s reliance on finite fossil fuels, and shields your town or city from the price volatility of the fossil fuel market.</p>

<p>Converting to renewable energy can reduce or eliminate the detrimental impacts of fossil fuels. Your community may save money after the initial upfront cost on renewable energy installation is paid back by generating on-site, clean energy.</p>
