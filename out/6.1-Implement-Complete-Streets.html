<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/6.1_Implement_Complete_Streets.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Commit to, plan for, and implement projects that provide inclusive and safer mobility and access for all roadway users--including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, and motor vehicles--regardless of age, ability, income, or ethnicity.</p>

<p>Complementary Actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/41">Encourage Smart Commuting</a></p></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Build a Complete Streets Team that reflects the demographics of your town, including residents who experience barriers to transportation or mobility based on economic conditions, physical ability, age, or geographic location within your town. An existing bicycle and pedestrian or other committee could be used and potentially expanded. Organize at least one Complete Streets meeting or workshop with a broad group of stakeholders, beyond membership of the Complete Streets Team. Discuss both opportunities and barriers associated with adoption of a Complete Streets policy and/or Complete Streets implementation. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A list of members of the Complete Streets Team; date of the most recent Complete Streets Team meeting held; the date(s) of the Complete Streets stakeholder meeting(s) or workshop(s); and at least one additional piece of documentation related to the meetings or workshops, such as a promotional flyer, an agenda, minutes, presentations, sign-in sheets or photographs.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Committee/Task Force/Position Creation" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have at least one municipal elected officials and/or staff member and/or members of relevant commissions participate in a Complete Streets training. Any training pursued here may not also count for points under Sustainable CT Action <a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/46">Train Municipal Representatives</a>. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The names, titles and contact information of the individuals who attended the training, as well as the name of the training, date it occurred, and organization that provided the training.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Events, Meetings, Trainings" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By municipal resolution or ordinance, adopt a Complete Streets policy that states an intent to plan, design, build and maintain all roads to meet the needs of all users, and ideally:</p>

<p>Specifies that “all users” include pedestrians, bicyclists, transit vehicle users and motorists of all ages and abilities; identifies current barriers to mobility and transportation for members of your community and potential solutions; commits to create a comprehensive, integrated, connected multi-modal transportation network within the community, recognizing each community’s specific local context and resources; considers regional connections; recognizes the need for flexibility since all streets are different, and user needs vary in each community; applies to both new and retrofitted projects, including design, planning, construction, maintenance, and operations, for the entire right-of-way; makes exceptions to the policy when specific safety concerns exist and sets a clear procedure that requires high-level approval prior to granting exceptions; considers public health during planning and design program phases; requires all initial planning and design studies of complete streets infrastructure projects to consider opportunities to improve public health; and acknowledges the potential benefits of complete streets. <strong>(20 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Your officially adopted Complete Streets policy, a completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/6.1/6.1.3_Worksheet.docx">worksheet 1</a>, and evidence that you distributed the adopted policy to relevant municipal departments (either via email, an in-person meeting, a staff newsletter, or other channels).</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inventory and review planning and design documents. Conduct an audit of existing plans, policies, ordinances, procedures, and other guidance documents to ensure consistency with Complete Streets Team meeting and workshop discussion outcomes, and ideally, an adopted Complete Streets policy. Such documents may include the Master Plan, Bicycle/Pedestrian Plan, Circulation Element, project selection criteria, and design guidelines. Reviewing guidance documents may be an ongoing process since some issues may not be identified until project development. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Your inventory of planning and design documents that require update to incorporate Complete Streets program objectives; a checklist of the changes that you need to make to each document listed in the inventory; and ideally, planning or design documents that have been updated as a result of the inventory and review process, with changes from the original highlighted or noted in some fashion.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Complete Streets have numerous environmental, health and wellness, economic well-being, community building and equity-related benefits. A robust process of community engagement and education will increase legitimacy and support for a Complete Streets policy, result in greater community ownership and greater likelihood of successful implementation, and promote equity by increasing the likelihood that potential racial, ethnic and socioeconomic inequities can be addressed in the Complete Streets policy and its ongoing implementation. Building a Complete Streets Team and organizing a broader stakeholder event can strengthen relationships between departments within the municipality, clarify municipal policies and procedures as they relate to Complete Streets, and save money by identifying local thought leaders and innovators with expertise in municipal planning and design.</p>

<p>Designing roadways that include all appropriate forms of transportation can reduce serious injuries and fatalities by lowering the number of speeding drivers and providing access and accommodation for all potential travelers. Safer roadways encourage residents to walk and bike more often, which can greatly improve their health. Increased walking, biking and transit use also cuts carbon dioxide emissions, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, promotes resilience and increases local economic vitality. Complete Streets provide appropriate transportation options to the approximately 30 percent of residents that cannot or choose not to drive. The implementation of a Complete Streets policy institutionalizes the commitment to providing a transportation network that accommodates all users, improving livability and quality of life for the entire community.</p>
