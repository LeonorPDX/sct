<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action is available for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong> and was newly added in 2021, in partnership with the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness and the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Develop an informed and coordinated response to homelessness within the municipality.</p>

<p>Complementary Actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/72">Increase Public Awareness and Support for Efforts to End Homelessness</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/76">Strengthen Municipal Workforce Capacity to Address Homelessness</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/70">Collect and Share Homelessness Data</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/73">Provide or Mobilize Resources to Address Homelessness</a></li>
<li>

</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Work with your municipality’s <a href="https://cceh.org/work/coordinated-access/">Coordinated Access Network (CAN)</a> to enable a standardized assessment and referral process to connect people experiencing a housing crisis or homelessness with community resources.  Depending on your community, collaboration with the CAN could include designating point-people between the municipality and the CAN and/or formalizing how the municipality will participate in CAN operations and decision-making. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>Note:</em> The point person may be the same point person designated in the Sustainable CT Action <a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/76">Strengthen Municipal Workforce Capacity to Address Homelessness</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A letter, contract, or other written articulation between your municipality and the CAN, designating the municipal point person responsible for connecting people experiencing a housing crisis with the CAN and identifying which municipal resources, if any, will be allocated to/aligned with CAN priorities; and sample forms or process workflow the municipality and CAN will use to implement the assessment and referral process, and a brief description of that process.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Committee/Task Force/Position Creation" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points.
