<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/3.2_Create_a_Watershed_Management_Plan.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Plan comprehensively for watershed management.</p>

<p>If your municipality has a waterway or waterbody that is important to residents, then a watershed plan for that resource is advised. A watershed plan provides a logical and convenient framework for assessing problems, planning solutions, and providing information on natural resources within the watershed and threats to them. Your plan could take the form of a “watershed-based plan” required by federal and state agencies in response to a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) designation, but it could also be informally developed by stakeholders.</p>

<p>Complementary Action:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions#open/action/3">Engage in Watershed Protection and Restoration</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<p><strong>Watershed Management Plan (up to 30 points)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Inventory <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>All elements must be completed to receive credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong>  Conduct a Natural Resources Inventory for a watershed (for more information on natural resources inventories, see Sustainable CT Action <a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/5">Create a Natural Resource and Wildlife Inventory</a>). A watershed is the area of land that drains or sheds water into a specific receiving waterbody, such as a lake or a river. As rainwater or melted snow runs downhill in the watershed, it collects and transports sediment and other materials and deposits them into the receiving waterbody. All waterbodies are part of a watershed.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Your completed Natural Resources Inventory.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Map and identify critical watershed resource areas to include, if possible: aquifers, riparian corridors, wetlands, vernal pools and headwaters.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A map depicting all aquifers, riparian corridors, wetlands, vernal pools and headwaters.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Map land uses and possible locations where pollutant loads may enter the watershed. Include estimates of pollutant loads according to area and type of land use, using formulas available from various sources (e.g. US Environmental Protection Agency, CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, Conservation Districts). Use information that already exists in total maximum daily loads (TMDL) or watershed-wide management plans developed by watershed organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A map depicting land uses and possible locations where pollutant loads may enter the watershed.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Regulation Review and Alignment with Watershed Protection Goals <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>All elements must be completed to receive credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Identify your watershed protection goals.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Review existing zoning and subdivision regulations for alignment with watershed protection goals.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong>   Modify and adopt complementary regulations to promote watershed protection goals.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A list of your watershed protection goals; a summary of your regulation review, including a description of your regulations align (or do not) with your watershed protection goals; and copies of all complementary regulations edited or enacted to promote watershed protection goals.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action Plan <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong>  Based on your completed inventory and regulation review, develop a list of priority actions and projects, including restoration projects, for reaching watershed protection goals, identifying project need, anticipated project costs, timeline and work plan.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Copy of action plan and a completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/3.2/3.2.3_worksheet.docx">worksheet</a>. Please note, successful completion of 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 are required before credit may be considered for 3.2.3.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points.

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>A watershed is the area of land that drains or sheds water into a specific receiving waterbody, such as a lake or a river. As rainwater or melted snow runs downhill in the watershed, it collects and transports sediment and other materials and deposits them into the receiving waterbody. All waterbodies are part of a watershed. Connecticut has eight major <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2719&amp;q=325628&amp;deepNav_GID=1654%20">watersheds</a>, but your town or city only needs to plan for local watersheds.</p>

<p>Watershed management is the practice of planning for and implementing strategies to maintain or improve the health and water quality of a watershed system. Since watersheds are, essentially, large areas of land that are the pathways for water flow in a region, there are many opportunities for pollutants to enter the system. Thus a thorough plan that includes an education component is important to protect the long-term health of the system. Watershed health is a barometer for health of the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Your community will have a water quantity and quality that is both fishable and swimmable.</p>

<p>You will help sustain drinking water levels for your citizens and surrounding populations.</p>

<p>By managing stormwater properly and minimizing point-source and non-point source pollution you will be able to sustain healthier watersheds and healthier wetlands, forests, meadows, etc. - creating healthier places for people to live, work, and play.</p>
