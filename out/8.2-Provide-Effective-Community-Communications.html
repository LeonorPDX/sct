<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Open communications are essential to making your local government inclusive. Effective community communications channels facilitate government transparency, build trust within your municipality, and create cohesion between and among community members. Information should be accessible to all, and should respond to changing demographics within a community.</p>

<p>Traditional communications channels send the stream of information in one direction: from the person or organization in power to the citizens. Using newer forms of media, you can foster a two-way flow of information that connects your municipality with citizens “where they are,” and with the type of media available to them.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>By creating open communications channels, you will enable your citizens to stay abreast of local initiatives, policy developments, and events.</p>

<p>Making communications a two-way street will empower all residents in your community to speak their minds and participate in local government at whatever level is comfortable for them.</p>
