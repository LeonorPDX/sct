<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/3.8_Implement_Low_Impact_Development.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Inspire low impact development (LID) projects in your community.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>According to the nonprofit, Center for Watershed Protection, “as much as 65% of the total impervious cover over America’s landscape consists of streets, parking lots, and driveways –what center staff refer to as ‘habitat for cars.’”</p>

<p>Rainwater hitting these surfaces does not penetrate and ends up flowing directly into streams and rivers. When water does not have a chance to penetrate the aquifer before arriving at streams, a host of issues arise– polluted water enters streams, the water is too hot from being on the pavement, streams fed by groundwater dry up, and the wetlands fed by springs dry up. All of this is very disruptive to wildlife, and nature in general.</p>

<p>Roadway and parking surface pollutants come from automobiles, and building and construction waste. Pavement collects nitrogen oxides from car exhaust, rubber particles from tires, debris from brake systems, phosphates from residential and agricultural fertilizers, and dozens of other pollutants, all of which get washed directly into streams and rivers before being cleansed by microbes filtered by soil.</p>

<p>To handle the volume of stormwater running off large impervious areas, communities install catch basins, piping, and culverts. These stormwater management systems are expensive to install and maintain. If not properly maintained, areas flood.</p>

<p>Flooding and pollution affect both environmental and economic sustainability by making activities like swimming, fishing or shell-fishing unappealing at best, dangerous or impossible at worst.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>One successful strategy to reduce urban runoff that has emerged in the past 20 years is the use of low impact development (LID) practices, also know as green infrastructure. LID practices include green roofs, pervious pavements, rain gardens, bioretention cells, and roadside bioswales.</p>

<p>Also, LID practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Allow rainfall to seep into the ground, which<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reduces the runoff that enters the stormwater system, and thereby<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Reduces flooding<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Improve water quality by allowing the natural soil to filter and reduce pollutants, and<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Reduce “heat island” effects in urban communities.</p></li>
