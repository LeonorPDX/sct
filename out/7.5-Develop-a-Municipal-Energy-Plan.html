<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Municipal energy planning is a process whereby towns actively set goals and action items to achieve energy reduction, demand response, and clean power production.</p>

<p>Key steps in energy planning include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Benchmarking current energy use (See Action <a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions#open/action/30">Benchmark and Track Energy Use</a>);</p></li>
<li><p>Establishing efficiency and sourcing goals; and</p></li>
<li><p>Establishing action steps through time that achieve those goals.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>A Municipal Energy Plan will help your community better understand its energy use and trends, opportunities for savings, and opportunities for switching to renewable fuels, which will enable your community to plan for long-term energy transitions and investments. While capital outlays are required at the outset, in the long run, such investments will save your community money.</p>

<p>Reducing energy use, alone, or in combination with sourcing energy via renewably generated power will also reduce carbon pollution as well as other air pollutants, and ultimately benefit both your local ecosystem and the global environment.</p>
