Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last update 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Increase the knowledge-base and effectiveness of your local boards and commissions.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Send commissioners from your community to a training that is relevant to their commission. <strong>(5 points each, up to 15 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Send at least one commissioner from your Inland Wetlands Commission and at least one commissioner from your Planning and Zoning Commission to a training relevant to their commission.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Send at least three land use/planning and zoning commissioners to attend a training on fair housing and/or other housing-related topics.</p>

<p><strong>For all Trainings:</strong><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The training may be online or in-person, in your community or a neighboring community. You may partner with neighboring towns to invite your council of government to provide a training session.</p></li>
<li><p>The type of training can be an event, workshop, webinar or conference.</p></li>
<li><p>If relevant, multiple people representing different commissions may attend the same training.</p></li>
<li><p>Activities that are used to earn points toward this Action may not be used to earn points toward any other Sustainable CT action (i.e., no "double-counting").</p></li>
<li><p>Commissioners serving as Alternates are eligible to attend a training under this Action.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> For each sub-action 1a, 1b, and 1c: The name of each commissioner (and their associated commission) who attended a training, as well as the name and date of the training (month and year will suffice).</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Events, Meetings, Trainings" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>
