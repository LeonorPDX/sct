Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last update 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Engage best management practices at the municipal level in at least one of the following areas: ground treatments, irrigation, land use practices, or stormwater runoff.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/3.11/3.11_GreenGrounds_Inventory.xlsx">Complete the hyperlinked inventory</a> for properties maintained by your municipality. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A copy of the completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/3.11/3.11_GreenGrounds_Inventory.xlsx">inventory</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best Management Practices (BMPs) <strong>(up to 15 points possible)</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Ground Treatment BMPs <strong>(5 points)</strong><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Utilize an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Standard.</em> IPM uses a combination of biological, cultural, physical/mechanical, and chemical management tools to solve pest problems while minimizing risks to people and the environment. Although every IPM program is different, successful programs use the same four-tiered approach, according to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency: 1) set action thresholds; 2) monitor and identify pests; 3) prevent or remove conditions that attract pests; and 4) control (Integrated Pest Management Fact Sheet. National Service Center for Environmental Publications. 2010).<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A copy of the IPM standard utilized with a description of how it is implemented.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Websites, Maps, Inventories, Checklists, Assessments, Plans, Ordinances, Policies, Regulations and Resolutions" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>

<p>OR<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Utilize an Organic Lawn Care Standard.</em> An organic lawn care standard eliminates the use of inorganic fertilizers and chemical pesticides, including fungicides and herbicides, in favor of ecologically preferable materials.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A copy of the organic lawn care standard utilized with a description of how it is implemented.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Irrigation BMPs <strong>(5 points)</strong><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Assess Annual Irrigation Patterns and Reduce Where Possible.</em> Assess your annual irrigation schedules. Limit irrigation when possible, by creating a responsive plan that stops irrigation if it’s raining or the ground is saturated, and limits irrigation in times of drought. Implement water-efficient practices such as installing an automatic irrigation system that allows for timing adjustments, and has a rain shut-off device and soil moisture sensor. Utilize low-flow irrigation equipment where appropriate. Irrigate in the early mornings, when possible.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A copy of your irrigation assessment with a description of the efficient irrigation practices implemented and amount by which this plan reduced irrigation (if available).</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>The types of grounds a municipality manages can vary, and each location within a community may require a unique maintenance plan. How your city or town manages its properties, however diverse, can have a large impact on the health and safety of neighborhoods and neighborhood habitats. For instance, fertilizer, insecticide, and herbicide cause negative impacts on human and animal health and on the environment. During rain events, these chemicals runoff from lawns, playing fields, and parks, and make their way to the Sound, where they can lead to hypoxia (low oxygen) – a deadly habitat condition for fish and lobster.</p>

<p>Overwatering can lead to wasted money, and a wasted resource – especially in times of drought.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Reducing or limiting the amount of fertilizer, herbicide, and insecticide will lead to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Reducing and filtering the stormwater runoff from your municipal properties, which:<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Protects your local aquatic habitats, and<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Increases your resilience to possible flooding events.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preventing weeds and unwanted pests without as many harmful repercussions,<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lower grounds maintenance expenses for your city or town due to using less water and fewer chemical ground treatments, and<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Reduced harm to the natural environment, including a healthier Long Island Sound,<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Healthier soils and healthier plants<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Safer places for residents to work and play:<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Improved health conditions for everyone who uses or maintains those grounds,</p></li>
</ul>
