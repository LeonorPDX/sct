<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Many municipal fleets are poorly funded, resulting in older equipment operating beyond its expected life-cycle date. This can lead to lower fuel efficiency and higher emissions.</p>

<p>By identifying your fleet needs as compared to your fleet stock, you can identify opportunities to increase the efficiency and cleanliness of your fleet.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Modernization and right-sizing your fleet and equipment will save money in fuel, which offsets higher upfront equipment costs.</p>

<p>Proper fleet management practices ensure optimal operation, lower operating costs, reduced emissions, decreased demand for replacement parts, and optimal fuel efficiency. Fleet management practices that reduce the amount of petroleum products used (e.g. using synthetic oils) will lead to decreased demand for petroleum and fewer disposal requirements.</p>

<p>Since your fleet will use less fuel, the community will emit fewer greenhouse gases, leading to cleaner air and improved health conditions for residents.</p>
