</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>This action enables you to earn Sustainable CT points for energy efficiency reductions in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Individual buildings (as opposed to the Reduce Energy Use Across All Municipal Buildings Action which rewards energy use reductions across the entire municipal building stock), or</p></li>
<li><p>Municipal water treatment facilities, which are typically measured by different metrics than other municipal buildings and have been excluded from the Reduce Energy Use Across All Municipal Buildings Action. Water and wastewater treatment plants are typically energy intensive, with 24/7 operations, and in many municipalities are the single largest energy users.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Through this action, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lower your municipality’s energy, operations, and maintenance costs;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Reduce your municipality’s harmful emissions;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Improve working conditions, indoor and outdoor air quality, and public health through reducing greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Extend the useful life of your municipal infrastructure; and<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Reduce your community’s reliance on finite natural resources.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also shift focus to individual certified buildings, which may enhance their desirability as venues for events and meetings.</p>
