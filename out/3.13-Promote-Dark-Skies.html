<p>Implement a light pollution outreach program in your town that includes, but is not limited to, one or all of the following:<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Presentations or workshops on the impacts (both local and global) of light pollution;</p></li>
<li><p>A searchable, navigable space on the municipal website for light pollution awareness and education and associated social media outreach; and/or</p></li>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Light pollution is caused by excessive, misdirected and/or misused outdoor lighting that has the potential to harm human health and safety, wildlife, and the environment. Although light pollution is most prevalent in larger cities, even relatively small amounts of light and excess lighting in smaller towns can be noticed and create problems in rural areas.</p>

<p>Light pollution is the silent threat to wildlife and ecosystems. Excess light disrupts the reproduction patterns of many animals, alters migration patterns, and increase deaths by drawing animals away from their habitats and exposing them to predators. Light pollution also threatens aquatic ecosystems by increasing harmful algae blooms. For humans, mismanaged and misdirected lighting can impact quality of life by limiting our ability to view beautiful night skies and disrupting our natural circadian rhythm. However, the needs of the community may be balanced by employing adequate, well-directed lighting to uphold public safety.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>By mitigating light pollution, residents of municipalities will experience both health and safety benefits. According to the International Dark Skies Association, wildlife in and around your municipality may experience benefits in reproduction, nourishment, sleep and protection from predators and may experience fewer deaths/losses to their populations.</p>

<p>Light pollution reduction produces several co-benefits in addition to improving outcomes for wildlife, ecosystems, and human health and safety. Mitigating light pollution can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions through saving energy—the less and/or more efficiently we light our towns, the less energy is used and the more we are able to reduce the production of harmful greenhouse gases.  Additionally, towns may save money on energy bills by removing or upgrading streetlights or by introducing part-night lighting, dimming measures, and lower-energy lighting.</p>
