<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>A watershed is the area of land that drains or sheds water into a specific receiving waterbody, such as a lake or a river. As rainwater or melted snow runs downhill in the watershed, it collects and transports sediment and other materials and deposits them into the receiving waterbody. All waterbodies are part of a watershed. Connecticut has eight major <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2719&amp;q=325628&amp;deepNav_GID=1654%20">watersheds</a>, but your town or city only needs to plan for local watersheds.</p>

<p>Watershed management is the practice of planning for and implementing strategies to maintain or improve the health and water quality of a watershed system. Since watersheds are, essentially, large areas of land that are the pathways for water flow in a region, there are many opportunities for pollutants to enter the system. Thus a thorough plan that includes an education component is important to protect the long-term health of the system. Watershed health is a barometer for health of the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Your community will have a water quantity and quality that is both fishable and swimmable.</p>

<p>You will help sustain drinking water levels for your citizens and surrounding populations.</p>

<p>By managing stormwater properly and minimizing point-source and non-point source pollution you will be able to sustain healthier watersheds and healthier wetlands, forests, meadows, etc. - creating healthier places for people to live, work, and play.</p>
