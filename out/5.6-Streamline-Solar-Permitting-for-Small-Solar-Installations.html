<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Each of Connecticut’s 169 municipalities has its own permitting processes, permit application and fee structure, which makes widespread solar deployment a challenge. By streamlining the procedures and documents required for a permit, your town or city can encourage more sustainable projects, including solar, and bring more business into your community.</p>

<p>We developed the recommendations and resources for improving rooftop solar PV (&lt; 1 Megawatt) permitting in this action from research conducted by the Connecticut Rooftop Solar Challenge team. These suggestions align with the work of leading organizations throughout the nation that are working to help understand and improve solar PV permitting processes.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>You can reduce everyone’s guesswork and frustration by creating open access to information, streamlining permit application submissions, implementing online permitting software and waiving or reducing permit fees.</p>

<p>Help contractors get it right the first time by clarifying the information they should provide when they apply for a solar PV permit.</p>
