A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/10.1_Encourage_Healthy_and_Sustainable_Food_Networks.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last update 2020)</p>

Designate a person(s), agency(ies) or committee to lead the local or regional Food Policy Council. The purpose of the Food Policy Council, among others, is to examine, connect and improve all component parts of the food system, including through policy recommendations. You may leverage your Sustainability Team or other existing committee to assist with this task or partner with an existing community organization. Consider joining the <a href="https://ctfoodsystemalliance.com/food-policy-councils-of-connecticut-collaborative/">Food Policy Councils of Connecticut Collaborative</a>. <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct a Community Food Assessment <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Gather data on at least 10 indicators of food access. This baseline data collection will help explain why residents are making certain food choices based on convenience, availability, and affordability. Data points might include income levels, unemployment rates, eligibility for free school lunch, public transportation need or options, and quality/quantity of food retailers.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Using the baseline data to prompt discussion, host a series of dialogues on priorities and strategies for improving food access. This input should come directly from residents as well as community leaders and members of citizen boards and committees of the municipality (e.g. Health Services, Youth Services, School Board, etc).</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Assemble information gathered into a Community Food Assessment Report.</p>

<p><em>The following data points and sources are readily available from the <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">U.S. Census</a>, other national data sources, and the <a href="http://www.zwickcenter.uconn.edu">UCONN: Zwick Center for Food and Resource Policy</a>:<br><br></em></p>

<p><em>The following potential indicators will require more customized, local research:</em><br><br></p>

<li>Map of emergency food providers (such as food pantries, soup kitchens and mobile pantry distribution).</li>
<li>Number of community garden plots and number of people directly benefiting from renting community garden plots (e.g., household size of each gardener).</li>
<li>Value of nutrition incentives redeemed at local farmers’ markets during the last seasons, including double value coupons, WIC coupons, and senior farmers market coupons).</li>
<li>Number of active school gardens and number of students with 10 or more hours of hands-on learning in the garden.</li>
<li>Number of school-age students that participate in community programs that connect youth to growing foods and food enterprises.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Including resident and stakeholder participation, create a Community Food Action Plan to ensure that all community members can access sustainable, healthy food. Consider subpopulations (including variations in income, race, ethnicity, national origin, and age). <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Enhancing food security improves the general health and wellness of your community and promotes equity. Addressing malnutrition also enhances a community’s capacity for economic growth and community building. When food security is considered in the context of sustainable food choices, increasing access to locally grown products can also reduce adverse environmental impacts and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
