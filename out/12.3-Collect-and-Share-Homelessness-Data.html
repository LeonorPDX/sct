<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action is available for the current certification cycle and was newly added in 2021, in partnership with the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness and the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Develop an informed and coordinated response to homelessness within the municipality.</p>

<p>Complementary Actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/72">Increase Public Awareness and Support for Efforts to End Homelessness</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/76">Strengthen Municipal Workforce Capacity to Address Homelessness</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/74">Coordinate Municipal Services to Address Homelessness</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/73">Provide or Mobilize Resources to Address Homelessness</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/75">Improve Outcomes for People Experiencing Homelessness</a> (including steps to decriminalize homelessness and connect with systems)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>Note:</em> The United Stated Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines literal homelessness as follows: “Individuals and families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and includes a subset for an individual who is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less and who resided in an emergency shelter or a place not meant for human habitation immediately before entering that institution.” <strong>“Unsheltered”</strong> refers to individuals and families who meet this definition and are not currently residing in a shelter. For more background on how HUD defines different categories of homelessness, click <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/PIH2013-15HOMELESSQAS.PDF">here</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Collect information on all individuals and families in your municipality experiencing literal homelessness, including unsheltered homelessness.  This information will help <a href="https://cceh.org/work/coordinated-access/">Coordinated Access Networks (CANs)</a> with supporting municipalities in connecting residents experiencing homelessness with services.  Share information on residents experiencing homelessness in your municipality using <a href="https://cceh.org/my-town-cares/">the data collection form</a> provided by the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness (CCEH).  As part of this process, according to a specific timeline to be published by CCEH, submit a list of locations where you plan to identify individuals who may be experiencing homelessness and identify individuals at those locations during two different time periods. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A screenshot (saved as a PDF) of the email sent to CCEH, listing locations to survey, and the confirmation from CCEH of surveys received.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit and rolling credit. This action falls under the action type "Data Tracking/Benchmarking and Meeting Performance Metrics" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for detailed submission requirements.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-5">Engaging Partners</h2>

<p>Sustainable CT encourages regional collaboration and other forms of partnership. For every action, please complete the “Partners” box in your submission, indicating the name(s) of any municipalities and/or organizations you partnered with (if any) and a brief description of your municipality’s role. If you collaborate with other municipalities, each community will receive points. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Partners_Guidance_Document--FINAL.pdf">"Partners Guidance Document"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-6">Potential Municipal and Community Collaborators</h2>

<p>Key collaborators to implement this action include Health and Human Services staff, police, EMS, fire departments, library staff, schools, youth services staff, and municipally employed outreach staff.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-8">Benefits</h2>

<p>Systemic data collection will provide your local Coordinated Access Network (CAN) with a comprehensive snapshot of individuals in your community in need of services. CANs will use this data to identify residents in need of services not currently connected with resources, allowing your municipality and CAN to develop a coordinated approach to meeting the needs of people experiencing homelessness within your community. Comprehensive state-wide data also allows Connecticut to advocate for resources to meet the needs of individuals experiencing homelessness in all 169 municipalities.</p>
