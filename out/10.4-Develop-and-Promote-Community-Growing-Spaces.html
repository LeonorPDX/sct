<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>As the effects of food insecurity, climate change, and economic inequality continue to impact our communities, towns can promote and create impactful spaces that increase fresh food availability, sense of community, connection to food and the environment, and positive environmental effects. As the food insecurity rate in Connecticut is 11.3% and rising, it is imperative that we create consistent and reliable sources of local, healthy food for residents experiencing hunger.</p>

<p>Community-led and -maintained spaces for gardening, farming, or other forms of plant growing and horticulture are vital in combating alienation that results from our fast-paced and often isolationist culture by creating gathering spaces for social cohesion, discussion, and learning. These spaces have the potential to create safer, more livable communities by sharing food production and dietary knowledge with the broader community and by fostering physical activity and healthy movement.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Opportunities for community gardening, farming, or other growing practices yield environmental, social, and health co-benefits for towns and their residents. Community growing spaces enhance the health of community members both by increasing physical activity through maintenance activities and by improving food security, dietary habits, and healthier food intake through education and fresh food availability. Creating opportunities for hands-on gardening and farming work incites community cohesion through new gathering places and educational opportunities while providing mental health benefits, relaxation for residents, and aesthetic improvements to the community. Environmental benefits of community growing spaces include the conservation and/or remediation of land, the improvement of air and soil quality, increased biodiversity of and habitat for plants and animals, reduced “food miles” required to transport nutritious food, reduced neighborhood waste through composting, and the improvement of the municipal micro-climate. Dedicated spaces for plant cultivation and horticulture also alleviate the local effect of climate change on agricultural output and fresh food unaffordability by making health food and plant products accessible.</p>
