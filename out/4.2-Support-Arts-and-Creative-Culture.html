<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>By creating permanent governmental offices or positions, various regulations, contractual relationships with cultural organizations, municipal ownership of spaces reserved for creative activities, tax abatements that help creative people to live or work in the community, you create a municipality where arts and culture can thrive. Ongoing municipal support demonstrates that your city/town values, encourages and invests in arts and culture and recognizes its positive impact on the economy, quality of life, and civic vitality.</p>

<p>According to the CT Department of Economic and Community Development's Office of the Arts, the arts are integral to building and unifying our communities, "63% believe the arts lift them up beyond everyday experiences; 73% believe the arts are a positive experience in a troubled world; 62% believe that the arts help them understand other cultures better; and 67% believe the arts unify their communities regardless of age, race, and ethnicity."</p>
