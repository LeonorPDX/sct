<li>
<p>Municipal Management of Invasive Species <strong>(10 points)</strong></p>

<p><em>All elements must be completed to receive credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Examine your regulations to ensure that your municipality is not unintentionally supporting the use of invasive species. Eliminate all invasive species from lists of acceptable plants (include a review of subdivision guides’ approved planting lists).</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Invasive species are non-native plants, animals and other organisms that cause harm or are likely to cause harm in the ecosystem where they are introduced, by outcompeting or displacing native species. They oftentimes are fast growing and can spread quickly, so their management requires and all-hands-on-deck approach by municipal staff and residential property owners looking out for and removing invasive species wherever possible. Examples of invasive plants in Connecticut include Oriental Bittersweet, Multiflora Rose and Winged Euonymus/Burning Bush. Invasive aquatics include Zebra Mussels and Curly Leaf Pond Weed. Insects such as the Asian Long Horned Beetle and the Emerald Ash Borer can also cause serious problems to name a few.</p>

<p>Public education and management of invasive species are equally critical elements of a comprehensive plan aimed at protecting native species and their habitats, leading to healthier, fully-functioning ecosystems. The dollar cost to not properly managing invasive species can be quite high, as invasive species may impact commercial fisheries, agricultural operations, and more.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>By inspiring the community to shift their land management plans, you will facilitate the establishment of small sanctuaries of native species.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this benefits everyone in the community by promoting cleaner air, clean and fully functioning waterways, etc.</p>
