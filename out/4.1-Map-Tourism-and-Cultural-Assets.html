<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Benefits</h2>

<p>Tourism and cultural asset mapping provides a collective inventory of the positive and valued aspects of a community, including places, institutions, programs, and people. Recognizing that resources constantly change, your tourism and cultural asset map will need to be regularly reviewed and updated.</p>

<p>By mapping tourism and cultural assets and making the map freely available to the public, your town will:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Assist creatively inclined people in locating and identifying each other;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Enhance its reputation as a culturally (and, if applicable) ethnically diverse community;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Positively impact municipal planning by including community assets, such as employment centers and transportation, in the map, which provides insight into opportunities where arts, tourism, and culture investments can be strengthened and/or concentrated;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Enable municipal planners, nonprofits, and developers to more easily integrate arts, tourism, and culture into economic development and housing projects, by revealing how your unique assets relate to larger data sets;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Enhance the likelihood of foot traffic and tourism/visitation to the community;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Mobilize your citizens to engage and celebrate the area’s creative strengths;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Increase community participation in outdoor and indoor spaces;<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Aid town organization, thus making it easier to collaborate, apply for grants, and evaluate public health and public safety projects and initiatives;<br><br></p></li>
<li>
<p>Make organizations and individuals known to the public outside your community, which will:<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Build connections nationally between regions, and/or<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Promote interest in your municipality from outside communities.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Promote a diverse array of partnerships and collaborations such as between: real estate/economic development, artistic/creative programming, asset-based marketing, and funder/capacity building partnerships.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>According to the CT Department of Economic and Community Development's Office of the Arts, the arts are integral to building and unifying our communities, "63% believe the arts lift them up beyond everyday experiences; 73% believe the arts are a positive experience in a troubled world; 62% believe that the arts help them understand other cultures better; and 67% believe the arts unify their communities regardless of age, race, and ethnicity." <br><br></p>
