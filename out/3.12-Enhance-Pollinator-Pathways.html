<ol>
<li>
<p>Provide education to residents and local businesses to improve pollinator habitat, reduce the use of insecticides on plants in flower, promote the addition of clover to grass lawns, and encourage the reduction of lawnmowing to once every 2 or 3 weeks. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p>Outreach may include:<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Creating and maintaining a searchable, navigable space on your municipal website and associated social media outreach;</p></li>
<li><p>Hosting educational events and workshops—which may be in-person or virtual—on pollinator friendly practices; or</p></li>
<li><p>Educational signage on municipal, residential, and business properties.<br><br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A description of outreach conducted, including copies of any educational materials used, methods of engagement, photos of events, groups in attendance, and/or a link to the dedicated space for pollinator education on your municipality’s website.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Create pollinator gardens, upgrade existing gardens to be pollinator friendly and educate the public about the importance of pollinators to society.

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Pollinators such as bees, flies, butterflies, moths, bats, and birds play a vital role in upholding and enhancing the well-being of society. Crops pollinated by insects include many of our fruits (apples, pears, cherries, strawberries, raspberries), fruiting vegetables (squash, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers), nuts (almonds) and sources of oils (sunflowers, canola).  According to the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/importance.shtml">US Forest Service</a>, over 1,000 of the plants we harvest and depend on for food, beverages, fibers and medicines require pollination. In the United States alone, bees and other pollinating insects produce $10 billion worth of food products every year.</p>

<p>In addition to their value to human food security and the agricultural sector, pollinating animals play a critical role in maintaining ecosystems. In our region, about 75% of all flowering plants are pollinated by insects or other animals. Birds and other wild animals feed directly on caterpillars and other insects and also feed on fruits and seeds that are the products of pollination. The increasing use of herbicides in agriculture has decreased the floral resources available to pollinators, and the pesticides highly toxic to bees are another threat. In addition, honeybees and other pollinators suffer from the global spread of parasites and diseases. These factors have led to local extinctions of pollinator species. Creating pollinator habitat free from pesticides helps to counter these threats.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Among the benefits to a municipality as a result of pollinator protection measures are enhancing agricultural production and local food supply/food security and protecting ecosystem services such as species protection and biodiversity. An important co-benefit of planting trees, shrubs and perennial plants is climate mitigation. Plants take up carbon dioxide, fix carbon as organic matter and produce oxygen as a result of photosynthesis, and pollinators are key to the reproduction of flowering plants that produce this vital service.</p>

<p>Other co-benefits of pollinator protection are the purification of water and prevention of soil erosion through sturdier roots and foliage to buffer the impacts of rain. Plants are needed to return moisture to the atmosphere and, of course, are dependent upon pollinators for reproduction. Creating pollinator pathways will also enhance community cohesion through new gathering places and educational opportunities that result from the creation of pollinator gardens.</p>
