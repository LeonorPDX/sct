<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/9.1_Report_Materials_Management_Data_and_Reduce_Waste.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Establish baseline municipal data by tracking and measuring (as required by state law) the amount of residential municipal solid waste generated and recycled per capita, educate and engage the public by disseminating that data, and ultimately, reduce residential solid waste.</p>

<p>Complementary Actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/49">Implement Save Money and Reduce Trash (SMART) Program</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/50">Recycle Additional Materials and Compost Organics</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify your town's staff member(s) responsible for collecting data on municipal solid waste and recycling and reporting that data to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), under Section 22a-207 of the Connecticut General Statutes. <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2714&amp;q=438534&amp;deepNav_GID=1645">Reporting information is available here</a>. Make publicly available annual data for residential solid waste generated per capita for at least two full years of data within the past three years. Data for each year runs from July 1 of one year to June 30 of the following year (the fiscal year). If your municipality collects solid waste directly, you already have the data required. If you use a subscription service, gather data from each hauler that holds a permit to collect waste in your community. One strategy for obtaining this data is to issue permits only to haulers that agree to provide residential solid waste and recycling data. Haulers that collect from multiple municipalities can provide good-faith estimates apportioning the total haul by town. <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/9.1/9.1_Per_Capita_Calculation.xlsx">Use this required worksheet</a> to calculate residential solid waste generated per capita. You can view an example of a completed worksheet <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/9.1/9.1_Per_Capita_Calculation_Example.xlsx">here</a>. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Contact information of the person(s) responsible for collecting and reporting waste and recycling data; the required data noted above; the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/9.1/9.1_Per_Capita_Calculation.xlsx">completed worksheets</a> on residential solid waste generated per capita for two full years of data within the past three years (one worksheet per year); and evidence that you publicly disseminated the data on your community’s website or elsewhere. Only the final calculated solid waste generated per capita for the year needs to be posted. It is not necessary to post the completed worksheets or the DEEP reporting forms, though you may. To document posting of your data online, please provide the electronic file or a screenshot, not a link.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Data Tracking/Benchmarking and Meeting Performance Metrics" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce residential solid waste generation per capita by at least 10%, compared to a baseline year within the past 5 years. Establish or identify a baseline year of data for residential municipal solid waste generation per capita. Using data from the most recent fiscal year at the time of submission, calculate the percent change of residential municipal solid waste generation per capita from the established baseline. To calculate residential solid waste generated per capita, use the <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/9.1/9.1_Per_Capita_Calculation.xlsx">required worksheet</a>, also provided in this action. 10 points will be awarded for each 10% reduction in municipal solid waste generation per capita. <strong>(up to 50 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/9.1/9.1_Per_Capita_Calculation.xlsx">worksheet</a> for your community’s residential solid waste generation per capita for the baseline year, a completed <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Action_Files/2021_Action_Worksheets/9.1/9.1_Per_Capita_Calculation.xlsx">worksheet</a> for the most complete fiscal year within the past three years, and a statement of the percent change between the two reported numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Data Tracking/Benchmarking and Meeting Performance Metrics" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="action-description-header-4">Timeframe for Credit</h2>

<p>Actions can either be “New” or considered for “Rolling Credit.”</p>

<p><strong>New Action Credit</strong>. Any action completed within the past three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification) is eligible for potential certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you may not claim New Action Credit for items that previously received credit.</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Credit</strong>. For any action older than three years (from January 1 of the year seeking certification), you must demonstrate ongoing, currently relevant, and meaningful impact in your community to be considered for certification points. If you are applying for recertification in your year of expiration, you must apply for Rolling Credit for any item that previously received credit, even if it was completed within the past three years.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Information regarding the origin, types, amounts, and destinations of municipal solid waste disposed and recycled&nbsp;is essential to establishing baseline data against which reductions in residential solid waste can be measured.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Waste reduction efforts decrease pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, resulting from methane production and emissions from incinerating waste. These positive environmental impacts can increase the health and wellness of your community members. Waste reduction can also save your municipality money and promote economic well-being.</p>
