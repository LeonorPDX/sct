<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Street lights are often a high energy cost to Connecticut’s cities and towns. Currently, the utility companies are engaged in a multi-year effort to replace street lights under their ownership with LED bulbs at no cost to the town. However, municipalities select when to opt-in. If your community owns the street lights, you are not required to transition to LED bulbs, but you may select to replace your lights with more efficient bulbs to reduce your energy use and save money.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>LED bulbs use about 70% less energy than traditional bulbs. Relamping can save both energy and money, and presents a wonderful opportunity to educate your citizens on real dollar savings.</p>

<p>Saving energy improves public health by reducing greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants and reduces reliance on finite natural resources.</p>
