<p>Committing to ending homelessness signals to your municipality and its residents your commitment to lending a helping hand to residents in times of need. Sharing resources online and through a town hall format ensures that individuals experiencing homelessness know what resources are available to them. It also ensures that residents are aware of options available to them to make meaningful contributions to efforts to end homelessness.</p>
