<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Building inclusive and equitable communities is a process that recognizes the intrinsic value of each member of a community and the need to connect; and is achieved when social, economic, and political opportunities are not predicted based upon a person's race, gender, age, or sexual identity. To build communities that embrace equity, Sustainable CT cities and towns will create a table where diverse relationships are welcomed and valued, where decisions are made collectively, and where success will be measured by having a variety of perspectives and experiences represented. Sustainable CT encourages cities and towns to include marginalized voices in their decision-making processes, and to specifically identify barriers to access for marginalized residents in order to identify and respond to community priorities.</p>
