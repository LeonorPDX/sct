<h2 id="action-description-header-1">Action Updates</h2>

<p>This action has been revised for the <strong>current certification cycle</strong>. A version of this action from the prior program year is <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Archived_Actions/2021_Actions/6.4_Support_Zero_Emission_Vehicle_Deployment.pdf">available for comparison</a>. Edits are highlighted in yellow. (Last updated 2020)</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-2">Objective</h2>

<p>Transition your fleet and create infrastructure for Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) that municipal employees, residents, business, and travelers may use.</p>

<p>Complementary Action:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://sustainablect.org/actions-certifications/actions/#open/action/29">Manage Municipal Fleets</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-description-header-3">What to Do</h2>

<p><em>The more you do, the more points you earn.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Sponsor or host a ZEV promotional event or education workshop with a community partner or third-party. For example, host a vehicle showcase day or educational session on the costs and benefits of ZEV ownership, etc. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The title, date, and a short description of the workshop.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit.

</li>
<li>
<p>Have at least one municipal elected official and/or staff member and/or member of a relevant commission participate in a training related to electrification of municipal vehicles. Topics may include but are not limited to electric school buses, zoning to support electric vehicles, and electric transit buses and shuttles. Having residents participate in such trainings may also fulfill the requirements of this Action, if the municipality describes in the “partners” section of its submission how the information learned will be shared with and applied by the municipal government.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Activities that are used to earn points toward this Action may not be used to earn points toward any other Sustainable CT Action (i.e., no “double-counting”).<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Attend 1 training = <strong>5 points</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Attend 5 and 10 trainings = <strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Attend more than 10 trainings = <strong>15 points</strong><br><br></p></li>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The names and contact information of the individuals who attended the training; the name of the training, date(s) it occurred, and the organization that provided the training; and a description in the “partners” field of your submission, if residents participated in the program, to describe how the information learned will be shared with and applied by the municipal government.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Events, Meetings, Trainings" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> Purchase receipts for zero emission fleet vehicles or generic hybrids and the number of total non-emergency passenger fleet vehicles in municipality.</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe for Credit:</strong> Eligible for new action credit. This action falls under the action type "Data Tracking/Benchmarking and Meeting Performance Metrics" (see <a href="https://sustainablect.org/fileadmin/Random_PDF_Files/Files_and_Resources/Timeframe_for_Credit_Guidance_Document-FINAL.pdf">“Timeframe for Credit” Guidance Document</a> for submission requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct an assessment of where ZEV charging infrastructure is needed in your community (public and private). Identify the areas within your town that have the appropriate characteristics to host charging and if not the exact properties, then the approximate neighborhoods. Characteristics that support this assessment include traffic throughput and/or whether a critical mass of destination parking exists, as well as proximity of municipal property where a town has purview over whether or not charging will at some point be installed. The assessment should ideally also include proximity to neighborhoods and commercial districts that have varying demographic characteristics and housing types. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> A copy of the assessment.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Host at least one electric vehicle charging station (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) for public use. If the electric vehicle charging station is not sited on municipal property, include an explanation of why an alternative location was selected and demonstrate proof of purchase by the municipality. <strong>(5 points)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong> The address of the municipal property where the station is installed and either a photo of the charging station and/or a receipt of purchase. If the electric vehicle charging station is not sited on municipal property, include an explanation of why an alternative location was selected and demonstrate proof of purchase by the municipality.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-9">Why This Matters</h2>

<p><span></span>Roughly 40% of Connecticut’s greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to the transportation sector, which runs primarily on fossil fuels. At the state level, Connecticut is committed to supporting ZEV deployment, and the Connecticut Departments of Transportation and Energy and Environmental Protection have partnered to create <a href="http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2684&amp;q=525224&amp;deepNav_GID=2183"><em>EVConnecticut</em></a>, a one-stop shop for all things ZEV. Connecticut has also signed on to the <a href="http://www.zevalliance.org/"><em>International ZEV Alliance</em></a> to accelerate ZEV uptake in the state. ZEVs include pure battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles.</p>

<h2 id="action-description-header-10">Benefits</h2>

<p>Transitioning to zero-emission vehicles and their supporting infrastructure allows your municipality and residents to take charge of your transportation footprint, while also providing many other benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you drive a ZEV, you produce far less air pollution than a traditional car or truck, creating healthier places to live, work and play.<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>ZEVs are often cheaper to drive and maintain. Residents can spend an excessive portion of their budgets on travel, but ZEVs offer a lower-cost opportunity than traditional vehicles. For instance, if you compare the price of a gallon of gas to an equivalent electric ‘gallon’ it’s about 40 cents <a href="https://energy.gov/articles/egallon-how-much-cheaper-it-drive-electricity#">cheaper</a>. ZEVs don’t require routine oil changes, which further reduces operating costs. There are other financial perks to driving a ZEV: in CT ZEV owners can register their ZEVs for only $38 for a two-year registration, while conventional gas vehicle owners pay $80!</p></li>
